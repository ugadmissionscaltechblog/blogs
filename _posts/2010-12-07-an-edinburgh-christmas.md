I know it's a little early to be talking about Christmas, but I can't help it! Christmas is a really big deal here. Starting exactly a month early (Nov 25), Edinburgh's Christmas on Princes St begins. There's so much to do there, from a giant ferris wheel and many other rides, an out door ice skating rink, and my favorite, a German Christmas market! As far as I know, there's nothing like this back in California, so the idea was incredibly exciting to me. (: There were so many cool things to look at.

And of course, no market is complete without lots of delicious food! Having a major sweet tooth, on my first trip I got a waffle with cinammon cream on top. It was sooooo good. &lt;3 Especially considering that it was absolutely freezing outside!

On the first day the festivities began, there were also these two really tall "christmas angels" *floating* around greeting people. It was probably the best and most hilarious thing I've seen there. How were they floating? Segways. Hidden under their giant dresses. Yes. Best Christmas Angels ever? I think so.
