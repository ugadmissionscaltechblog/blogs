Another trip I took was to Kamakura, which is about an hour outside Tokyo. Kamakura is famous for it's daibutsu (giant Buddha) and it's hydrangea flowers, which bloom in June. Thankfully, it was June when I visited, so I got to see some gorgeous flowers.

I also saw the Giant Buddha, which was indeed giant. It's shoes were bigger than I was!

While in Kamakura I also had the best Tenzaru Soba I've ever had. Tenzaru Soba is a kind of cold noodles that are served with tenpura and a sauce for dipping. They're really delicious, and in Kamakura I had them at this tiny noodle shop that you would miss if you weren't paying attention. It was an awesome find though!
