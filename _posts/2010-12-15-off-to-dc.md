Hey,So I'm back. Yay...ha. Anyways, this time I'm going to have a shorter blog that will cover the next few days. For those of you that read my other blog, sorry for not finishing it up. This summer/first term, I ended up being a lot busier than I initially expected. Anyways, now time to start this blog! In the early hours of Sunday morning, I left to the nation's capital to go on the Caltech Y, Science Policy Trip! In the next few posts I'm going to tell you a bit about my experience at the capital!Let me first start off by talking about the Caltech Y. There are tons of interesting clubs/organizations on campus, but I personally think the Caltech Y is one of the best. TheCaltechYwas founded in 1916 by and for students, as an opportunity to develop leadership. Today theYexists "to enrich student life and to provide opportunities that will challenge students to become engaged responsible citizens of the world."
