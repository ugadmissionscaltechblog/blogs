Facebook holds two big parties for its employees and their families, one during the summer and one during the holiday season. This summer, the party was held at Levi's Stadium, home to the 49ers.

It was basically a huge carnival, with face painting, carnival games, flash tattoos, magic shows, dance performances, and more. Many of the lounges were also open to serve food and provide shade for everyone. The usual stadium fare of pizza, hot dogs, and fries were also available.

I didn't arrive early enough to get the cute prizes at the carnival games, but I did get a flash tattoo and an airbrushed tattoo. After the party, my friends and I played badminton, and then went to Redwood City to get pizza and watch a movie. It was their last week at Facebook (since they're on the semester system), which was a bit sad. But, I'm really glad I made new friends this summer, and maybe we'll run into each other again!
