Get ready for a whirlwind review of Seattle's coffee shops! Seattle is full of coffee shops everywhere, so I've really only been to a few, but let me comment on and recommend some of the ones I've been to :)
**Caf√© An'clair**Located in South Lake Union. I can't believe I don't have photos of this one! I often went to this place to get bulgogi sandwiches for lunch. They sell really cute, yummy pastries and have unique coffee syrup flavors like orchid. They also have a good Spanish latte, but I tended to get the orchid breve since who has orchid syrup?? The Spanish latte is also a bit too cinnamon-y. I didn't realize they charge extra for breves in Seattle, but everywhere I went, a breve was more expensive than a latte. That's too bad since I like breves so much more than lattes :( (By the way, a breve is basically a latte but made with half and half rather than whole milk). It's a brightly-lit, cute space, and I really liked going to this place since it was &lt;10 min walk from work!
**Evoke Coffee**Located in South Lake Union, this coffee shop is super popular on Instagram with its but first, coffee sign. It's a relatively quiet coffee shop, and its mascot is an adorable Bernese Mountain Dog puppy lying in the corner. Their coffee has a darker roast but is quite good.

**Seattle Sunshine Coffee**Located northeast of U-District, this coffee shop features pretty standard drinks. It's a nice place to work and is well-lit, and there's a colorful glass chandelier in the middle :) There are two floors to this small-ish coffee shop.

**Bellden Cafe**This cafe is located in Bellevue, on the other side of Lake Washington from where I was staying. I thought it was also a nice place to work, but nothing special. They have conference rooms that can be opened or reserved. In the photo below, I'm sitting in one of those conference rooms!

**Zoka Coffee Roasters**This one is a chain, so there are a couple outlets, but I went to the one in Green Lake. Honestly it was my favorite coffee shop while I was here. Maybe it's because I like sweet coffee, and they had this delicious lavender mocha. I also love cozy but spacious coffee shops, and this place had the perfect vibe. The dark wood and yellow lights gave it a warm feel, and there was plenty of seating. When I was sitting here, someone behind me was reading a story they had written, and someone sitting in front of me was teaching two others Japanese!

Get ready for a follow up post with coffee shops featuring cute latte art and dark chocolate mochas :)
