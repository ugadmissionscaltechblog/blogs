Gas Works park is located on the north shore of Lake Union in Seattle. In the park, you can see the remains of the only remaining coal gasification plant in the United States. The plant operated from 1906 to 1956, and it became a public park in 1975.

From the park, there's a great view of downtown Seattle. The view at night is especially pretty!
