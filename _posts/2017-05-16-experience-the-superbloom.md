Page House's annual beach trip is a 3 hour drive southwards to Carlsbad. I noticed a field of yellow flowers right off the side of the road. I tried walking into the prickly field and all I found was more and more of the yellow flowers. This probably has something to do the with superbloom in California after we finally got out of the drought.

The mansion we rented out for the weekend is right across the street from the beach.

To get to the water, there is a grassy area with lots of purple white, succulent-likeflowers.

There's a way down to beach with stairs, but we chose to get to a sandier part by boulderingdown a precarious drop. Luckily, there were some friendly people who helped us find footholds.
