Hope you all had a great weekend!
I definitely did!...some highlights: In-N-Out, hanging out with friends, spending the day in Old Pas, enjoying the nightlife in Downtown Los Angeles, and ballet class. Now, it's back to work...

I'm currently working on a progress report for my next thesis deliverable due this Friday. In addition, I have been making a lot of progress in the experimental phase of the research. I have been working in the machine shop to alter some parts to bring back up to JPL for testing for the next few weeks.

I initially learned how to machine shop during my sophomore year at Caltech through my ME71 class (Intro to Shop). I was at first, really scared about dealing with the machinery since it can be really confusing to operate....and in there, you really have no room to make mistakes---you've got to be absolutely safe, constantly alert and know exactly what you are doing. The class was AMAZING. I would have to say it's one of my faves I've taken at Caltech---I got to build a transmission and a bubble machine! I also found that I have a natural flair for machining...and was able to do well in the course. It's also very empowering to know that I know my way around these machines down there, can really get my hands dirty and prove myself as a true MechE ;).
