Hiya,
Although I’m affiliated with Avery House, I am currently living off campus, which means I’m also off-board. My roommate Jessica (yes, she’s also a senior, an Averite, and chemistry major…confusing, I know right : P) and I have been cooking and baking up a storm together. Those of you who know me know how much I like to bake. Baking is like the chemistry of food, a combination of two of my favorite things. Jessica enjoys cooking, so I’ll be sharing with you throughout this year with our attempts and experiments :) Let me know if you have any suggestions and if you want to see more! I can also add recipes on here and explain how to make the things I post. For now, here's a few things we made this past month!
Bon appetit! :P
