I didn't know about this park before, but apparently there's a large open space park just 15 minutes away from Caltech, in Montecito Heights! It's also the home to the Audubon Center, which is a bird conservatory and education center. I went hiking here this past weekend :)

When hiking, we came across this old beat up car, a lake, and a beautiful view. There are actually quite a lot of trails here, so it's nice knowing that there are closer hiking areas of this size than the Santa Monica mountains!
