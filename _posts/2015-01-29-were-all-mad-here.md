Hey guys!

Every term, we have Midnight Madness, a break from studying and finals while munching on free breakfast foods. This year was the first year Chandler cafe was decorated towards a theme for the event. From afar, all that could be seen of Chandler cafe was a dark mass with a pulsating brilliant light. Upon entering, l was blinded by the darkness and all the glowing smiles--it was the Cheshire cat's grin without the rest of the face. And then if I wasn't too distracted by the flying glowsticks, I might have noticed the boba station. This was different from my typical boba selection, though. The "pearls" in these drinks were filled with fruity juice and popped under the slightest pressure.

We're all mad here. That's the best way to describe it.We grin because we like it here.

It's dark because we only really need to focus on one thing at a time.

And this is kind of usually true:

I'm a big Alice in Wonderland fan, so this was just an ideal Midnight Madness. Looking forward to whatever Chandler Caf√© cooks up next term, but this'll be pretty difficult to beat!

Keep lookin' up,

Jenny.
