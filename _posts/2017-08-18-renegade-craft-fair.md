The festival pavilion at Fort Mason in SF holds different exhibitions every week, depending on who reserves the venue. This week, it was the Renegade Craft Fair, where artists from around the world come to display and sell their handmade items. Complete with food trucks and coffee stands, it was a full fledged affair.

Right when we walked in, there were already beautiful works like these posters below. I love these kinds of events, since you can find unique items that you won't find in department stores or your local Urban Outfitters.

The fair was pretty crowded, and apparently there were people who flew from across the country to come here! At the fair, I bought a silver, simple galaxy necklace for myself (it's a silver circle with star-shaped holes inside) and a fox coaster. I would have bought even more, especially since I love posters so much, but I had to control myself ;D

The most beautiful item I saw was a hand made coffee pour-over kit. I should've taken a picture, but it was this beautiful white, but earthy, ceramic. I would have bought it, but I don't have a grinder for coffee beans and all those necessary materials to be a coffee hipster :P
 All in all, it was a great experience, and I would love to come again!
