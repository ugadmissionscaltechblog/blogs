While I don’t always enjoy the beach, I had a ton of fun going with friends. The first evening, we just enjoyed the views offered by the sunset (and took a ton of photos in the meantime). However, the second day was really when the majority of people had arrived to enjoy playing at the beach.

The day was overcast, so we didn’t get to see the sun. This also meant the water was quite cold - not many people were able to brave the cold. However, my friends and I entertained ourselves with other things: we buried one of our friends and made a moat around her. It was a really impressive mountain of sand - it looked like a little volcano. I also had fun trying to dig tunnels in the sand (they all collapsed unfortunately) and building drip castles with the wet sand.
