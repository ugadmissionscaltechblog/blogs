On Saturday, I went surfing!
Max, Sly, Andrew, Erin, John, and I all headed down to Bolsa Chica beach in the morning (I’m told that it means “Bag Lady” in Spanish, but it’s a really nice surfing beach, especially for beginners). We assumed it would be warm, so none of us brought wetsuits. There were a few tense moments when we first got there, as the sun was behind a cloud and it was freezing cold (Erin had to huddle under some towels), but it warmed up soon.

I was very careful to apply lots of sunscreen. The sun here is harsher than on the east coast. Last year, I tried to make do with spray-on sunscreen but, having never used it before, I didn’t realize that you are supposed to rub it in. I ended up with streaks all over my skin, alternating red and white. I looked ridiculous!John has a very fair complexion, so in addition to sunscreen, he had to hide under an umbrella.

In addition to his SURF, he's working hard to edit the Little T (an annually released guidebook to Caltech). He took a nap on the beach.

She had some trouble at first because the waves would dump her off her board, but she quickly got the hang of it. I managed to ride a wave all the way in to shore, so I was very pleased. Sly, who is better than the rest of us, managed to catch many waves. I even caught a picture of her standing up!
