Chinese New Year was on Saturday January 28. The date is based on the lunar calendar. Unlike New Year's Day which marks January 1st, Chinese New Year falls on a different day each year. This year is the year of the rooster. You can read more about the twelve zodiac years [here](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/social_customs/zodiac/).

I, along with many of my Chinese friends, went home for the weekend since Chinese New Year fell on a Saturday. Some of my friends even flew home out of state. My family had a Chinese New Year's Eve dinner, with lobster, noodles, fish, sticky rice, and more (see picture below). Long noodles are supposed to bring happiness and longevity, and fish is supposed to bring prosperity. We also went to dim sum with my grandma and my uncle's family on Sunday morning. The restaurant hired lion dancers to perform (see picture below)! Lions represent power and wisdom. They bring good luck and chase away evil spirits.
