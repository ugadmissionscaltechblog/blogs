But, if an alley wants to win, they basically need to do everything on the list. Everyone gets really competitive, running around places to try and get as many photos as possible. Alley 8 (my alley) came in second, behind Alley 3/4. There was only a 20 point difference between the alleys, with both having around 1350 points. Despite our loss, we were still really happy and went out to celebrate by eating hot pot.
