I thought I had covered all the basic British holiday features in my recent post- wrong! I went out to Christmas dinner with the lacrosse team (we're number one in the league!) today and learned a few new things.

For example, this is a Christmas cracker:

And for Christmas dessert, I'm told, two dishes are pretty traditional: mince pies andChristmas pudding (yes...Christmas pudding is a pretty obvious choice for Christmas day dessert...) Inside a mince pie is meat, fat, fruits, and spices. Christmas pudding ingredients include: fat, syrup, fruit, bread, spices, and brandy. For me, anything tastes better than fruit cake (my family's idea of Christmas dessert), so I was happy to indulge in a bit of pie and pudding! Speaking of which, sometimes in London people use the word 'pudding' to mean any kind of dessert,similar to how in the American South 'coke' can mean any kind of soda.

Of these three British twists to Christmas my favorite is definitely the crackers. I'll be taking some home for Christmas with my family!
