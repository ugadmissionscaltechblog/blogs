At the end of third term, Caltech hosts the Techstock music festival, where multiple bands perform to compete for a prize. There's usually also an artist invited to the event -- last year, the Mowgli's came to Caltech, and the year before, Bowling for Soup came.

This year, Totem and the Graduate Arts Committee hosted an art festival as part of Techstock. For Totem, we put up prints of this year's Art of Science exhibit! We've been working on hosting the Art of Science competition for the whole year, and it was finally time to exhibit the pieces :)
There was also a bouncy house, an inflatable obstacle course, and free soylent and food at the event. It was fun to hear all the performers, and even alumni came back to perform.
