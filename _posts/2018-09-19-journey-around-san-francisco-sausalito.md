The Bay Area is a ridiculously picturesque place, and few places can beat Sausalito. It's a small town that has intense vacation vibes, with small shops, a cute Main Street, views of the bay and a lot of ritzy houses. No wonder it's swarmed by tourists. Like San Francisco, a lot of the houses in Sausalito are built on hills, so you can definitely get a little workout just walking about.

This view was taken on some steps. They led from the main street to another residential street, but they were really steep! It can also be noted that there was a small bench surrounded by flowers up the steps, and the backyard of a house was also accessible from the stairs.

One of the coolest things about Sausalito is actually getting there. You can go to the Port of San Francisco at the Ferry Building and take a ferry across the bay. When Carl, the fog, isnâ€™t around, the ride across has really gorgeous views all around. We could see the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz, Angel Island, and other places around the bay. The view of San Francisco from the water is also astonishing, as it's not a view that we can necessarily see very often.

There are other ferry's that go from San Francisco to other places around the bay. You can see them in the Port of San Francisco/ Ferry Building marketplace: they have an old fashioned flip board that shows the ferry destinations and departures. Sometime in the future, I think I should go back to explore around the bay more - or at least ride another ferry.
