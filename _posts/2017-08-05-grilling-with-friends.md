A few weekends ago, my friends staying in San Jose invited us to grill at their apartment. With several great cooks there, the food was amazing. The meal included garlic bread, two salads, grilled veggies, three homemade sauces (chimichurri, onion vinaigrette, and a Brazilian vinaigrette), chicken wings, and a lot of grilled beef. As we were eating, the food just kept coming!

After getting stuffed with food, we played pool and jackbox games.It was really fun to hang out with the other Techers interning up in the Bay Area this summer! Two of us are actually graduated electrical engineers now working full-time in Santa Clara, and the rest of us are spread out from San Francisco down to San Jose (and one SURFing at Caltech), doing software engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and biology and physics research.
