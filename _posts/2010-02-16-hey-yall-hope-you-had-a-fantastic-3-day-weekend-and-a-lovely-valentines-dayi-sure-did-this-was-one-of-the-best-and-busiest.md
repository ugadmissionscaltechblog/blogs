Hey y'all! Hope you had a fantastic 3 day weekend and a lovely Valentine's Day!
I sure did. This was one of the best and busiest weekends I've had all term! YAY! :D
Friday night, I attended my good friend's going away party at the Tolman House (gorgeous venue on campus that visiting professors, etc stay in). It was a costume "Geek or Chic" party---Andrew and I showed up as "chic" (but we're still big geeks lol). The party involved a lot of food--yay for Filipino food, how I've missed you!, mingling with grad students/post-docs and a fun karaoke party towards the end. Couldn't help but to get up and sing some tunes....

She and I are from the same part of San Diego, both dancers, and both Filipino! Christie just finished her post-doc and is moving to Berkeley for a fabulous new job...she has been my older sister here, and has taught me so much. &lt;3
Saturday was a TON of fun too! A sophomore in my house, Aarathi and I attended Fleming House's Formal Valentine's dinner together, Wine and Candlelight. We spent the afternoon getting ready together at my room in Braun. So much girly fun!

Sunday, I had ballet and Valentine's Day FUN and adventures in LA. And Monday was a day of rest for me from the weekend...thank goodness we didn't have any class :)
