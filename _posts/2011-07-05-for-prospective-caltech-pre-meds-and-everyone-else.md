<span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;">June 25: The Awesomeness of Internet and Email 

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">The following is a recent conversation I had with a rising junior in high school whom I will call "D" from now on over correspondence by email. Some interesting facts about this conversation are:

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">1) I don't know D at all 

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">2) D apparently knows some information about me including that I am attempting premed at Caltech

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">3) The primary reason for emailing me was that D wanted to know what it is like to be a premed at Caltech

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">The first two facts would make D seem like a pro stalker, but I made a personal website last summer for fun, which I kind of abandoned once I finished the project, yes, some of my information is freely available to the public. I should probably update it, but in the meantime you can check out the old stuff <a href="https://yang-hu.com" target="_self">here</a> if you're interested. The website itself was only made as an alternative to facebook just in case I decide premed isn't right for me and instead, look for a job right after college I would have somewhere other than my facebook to refer people.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">The third fact is, however, is probably the most interesting for those of you premeds out there, who want to get a head start on knowing what it's like to be a premed at Caltech. I corresponded with D over three emails and will post the questions D asked and my response. I don't know if this will be extremely helpful for everyone of you, but my hope is that some of you will get a better understanding of premed at Caltech, even if it's only a little bit more. If you have questions after reading this, you can put them in the comments section. If you're reading this way after 2011, then drop an email, which can be found on my website. 

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">Before I sign off, I want to wish you all a happy July 4th! If you read this afterwards, I hope you had a fantastic July 4th! 

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">Until next week!

<span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">**===Correspondence between D and Me begins here=== **

<span style="color: #888888; font-size: 18pt;"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: #111111;">**Note: permission was obtained from D to have this correspondence posted**

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Email 1 (D to me): 
<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">
<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Yang,
<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">
<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">I'm a sophomore (soon-to-be junior) at my highschool, and have  always had a certain attraction to the idea of performingsurgery, and  medicine in general. With the idea hitting me that I have two years  until I'm done with high school, I started doing some research on  colleges and found CalTech.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">I'm in my school's I.B. Program, carry the workload fairly easy,  and have always considered myself a fairly dedicated, driven, and  intelligent student. My fear with CalTech -- if I'm even able to get in,  when the time comes -- is that I'll get there and find myself among an  echelon of genius so farout of my reachthat I can't even hope to make  it through the classes.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Combined with this, I've heard that pre-med students in CalTech are  rare, and ones with a GPA above 3.5 (like yours) are even more rare.  I'm also torn because I enjoy challenging myself, and I enjoy learning,  but I don't want to ruin my GPA in the process. Math is a strong focus  in CalTech, even for Biology majors (or so I've read), and I've always  been interested in and fascinated by math, but have never been  exceptionally skilled in it. I can pull a low A fairly casually, but I  imagine that CalTech would require something better.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Basically, this e-mail is asking advice from a person that I would  wantto be likein about four years. Did you find the core classes  drastically different from your courses in high school? Did you at any  point regret your choice of CalTech? How many Pre-Med students that you  know don't have a GPA above 3.5, or have completely dropped the idea all  together?

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Believe me that I'm willing to do the work, but I also understand  that sometimes, hardwork doesn't equate to thorough understanding.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">Thank you for your time and any answers you can give.

<span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00ffff;"><span style="color: #00bf00;">-- D
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-size: 18pt; font-family: andale mono,times;"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Email 1 Response (Me to D)**

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Hi D,**

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">Thank you for your email. I'm really glad you're considering Caltech**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> as a possible place to spend your college years. Reflecting back on my**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> admissions experience, I am very grateful that my mother made me apply**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> to this institution. It was probably one of the best decisions in my**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> life so far. You seem very dedicated starting your college search at**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> this time and sending emails to current students (how did you find out**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> about me?)! Keep up the good work!** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> You are right that I am studying premed at perhaps one of the most**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> difficult institutions to uphold a decent GPA. In fact, when I was**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> applying, I had the same worries. I wasn't confident that I would even**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> make it in! I remember being really afraid of starting classes because**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I had this premonition that everything would be so difficult and I**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> would be starting at the bottom of the pack. It turned out many of my**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> peers had the same worries. Don't get me wrong. It was difficult. It**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> is still difficult. Some days I feel really small, but I never**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> regretted and will never regret coming here. While academics can be**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> strife on some days, it is the smart individuals here that make the**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> college worth attending.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Now before I get further, I need to debunk a myth. If you are admitted**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> by Caltech, then you are capable and expected to graduate; otherwise,**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> you wouldn't be admitted in the first place. The caveat for premeds is**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> that in addition to graduating, we need to get good grades. Is it**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> impossible? No. Is it difficult? Very much so. Caltech is an**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> institution that takes pride in its students' ability to work hard,**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> but at the same time, the school gives many tools and resources to**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> help every student succeed including our wonderful collaboration**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> policy. The only thing necessary from the student is dedication to do**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> homework almost everyday of the week and to put in the necessary hours**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> to study study study. I can't stress that enough. Your ability to**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> study independently and to seek help when needed in the form of office**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> hours or tutors is really important for the premed. That being said,**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> half the students get 3.5 GPA or higher, so you don't have to hole up**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> in your dorm all day long and study every minute in order to get a**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> good GPA. In fact, Caltech encourages its students to be involved, and**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> as a premed, it is good to be involved anyway, so the school in**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> most cases is very supportive of the premed student. In fact**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> (debunking another rumor you brought up), we have quite a large**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> population of premed students at Caltech that we even have a**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> student-run premed association with many many members.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> In fact, biology is one of the top 5 most popular majors here, and the**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> majority of all biology majors are premeds! Exciting!** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Now to your questions: Core classes vary dramatically in difficulty. I**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> found calculus to be much more proof-based at Caltech, which is to say**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> there is more theory involved than using brute force and plug-and-chug**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> formulas to get your way through homework. Certainly there are**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> problems like that on your homework but Caltech emphasizes**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> understanding the concept rather than being able to apply a formula**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> because anyone can do the latter but not having control of the former.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Core was pretty difficult for me, but 2 terms out of 5 of it are not**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> on grades but on pass/fail, so there is no need to worry during your**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> first 2 terms. This may change to one term when you get here, but by**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> that time, core will be reduced to 3 terms. I got almost straight A's**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> through core. I remember getting one B and one A-. In reality, the**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> courses in my major (biology) were much much more difficult than core.**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> So, core for me was more of a grade booster. Core can be similar or**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> different. I heard that the IB program prepares you more adequately**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> for core than AP classes, so you will be fine if you get in.**

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">You say you will work hard, which is definitely required here at**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Caltech if you don't have a wide knowledge-base to begin with. I**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> believe you will work hard as you say, and will ultimately do fine if**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> you come to Caltech. As for understanding, it is definitely**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> recommended that you understand what you're learning, but I feel that**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> sometimes we rush through courses at lightning speed that there isn't**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> time to thoroughly understand every concept. This is where selectively**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> studying for tests and quizzes help the premed student. You may not**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> get a full understanding of what you're learning but you will know**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> enough to get by, which has helped me tremendously with my GPA.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I wish the best for you in your college application journey. Work hard**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> throughout your junior year because that is necessary and important**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> for success but please do me a favor and enjoy the latter half of your**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> senior year after you have applied to colleges. I remember working**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> hard even after applying to colleges and reflecting back, I now know I**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> lost time that I could have spent with people I will most certainly**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> not see anytime soon.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I hope you find my advice helpful!**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> **

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">**<span style="color: #00bf00;">Email 2 (D to Me)**

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">Your e-mail has given me some confidence. Knowing that acceptance means  that you already are believed to have the ability to pass clears up part  of my doubt, but as you said, pre-med students' worries extend beyond  that.

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">On more rumor for you to confirm or refute: I had read that certain  pre-med students that are overly aggressive or serious about their  grades (for reasonable concern) are sometimes ostracized at CalTech  because that sort of behavior is a bit taboo. I have always been serious  about my grades, though it's something that my friends and classmates  accepted long ago as just an ingrained belief. That's not to say that I  see them as the end-all be-all; I just know that GPA is something that  will follow you for a long time.

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">I also wanted to know if you had any research experience before  joining CalTech, like having a mentor and working at a university and  everything, and if so, did it make transitioning to Caltech easier?  Personally, that's somewhat diffcult; I live hours from any university  with any sort of research opportunities.

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">The idea of everything being more about understanding than ability  to mindlessly calculate is something I find interesting. That's the sort  ofphilosophy I wish my high schools teachers would take on.  Personally, learning a concept backwords and forwards makes it easier to  remember, easier to use, and frankly, is somewhat exciting (nerdy, I  know, haha). However,I understand that this isn't always true at  CalTech (as you mentioned, certain times courses are rushed). As I said  in my last e-mail, I find math fascinating, though I fear that pure  interest may not be enough to get through the classes; I will still need  a great amount of skill. In fact, learning in general is something I  consider a pastime.

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">But thank you again for your answers. They *were* helpful  and very in-depth, especially from a pre-med student who has made it  part way through with a very respectable GPAand can give me the insight  I want.

<span style="color: #00bf00; font-family: arial black,avant garde;">And I'll try to take it easy after college applications. :)

<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">**
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">In response to your first question, no one likes grade-grubbers, and unfortunately**
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">sometimes there is that stigma associated with premeds. The good news is**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> that at Caltech it is either unnoticed or very unpronounced. In fact,**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I always jokingly bring it up in front of people and it is actually**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> the pure biology majors who have more of a problem with it than anyone**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> else since a few of my pure bio major friends tend to not care so much about**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> their grades than their research and sometimes I inadvertently give**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> them a hard time by complaining about my own grades without realizing it. **
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">In that situation, however, they have every right to criticize me since **
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">I probably am giving them a hard time about their own grades without meaning to do so.**
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;">People here are too nice to give premeds a hard time for being premeds. **
<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I did have some research experience prior to coming here. That is**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> because nearby my home city is a national lab, so I got the opportunity to**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> work in a lab during my senior year for a year. However, don't be let**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> down. Admissions takes into account your location and resources, so if**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> you can't find a lab, that's no problem. Just don't say, "over the**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> summer, I played computer games all day long and did nothing else!"**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> That's not to say you should say you only work and have no life.**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Balance is the key with a leaning toward science!** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Research didn't really play a role in transitioning to college, but it**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> did help a little when I started my research internship over the**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> summer last year. That is to say you don't need research to get in. I**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> also know people who have never done research in their lives that have**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> gotten into Caltech. It's the passion for science and how you show it**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> in ways that are available to you that count!** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> I must say, if learning is what you consider a pastime, then Caltech**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> may be right for you. In fact, that is a recommended skill for any**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> college if you want to be successful there without problems. If you**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> have any other questions, please feel free to ask.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> Finally, thank yourself for being dedicated. If you keep that up, you**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> will go far. Also, I'm glad you plan to take it easy after**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> applications. As a general rule of thumb, it's always good to not**<span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> overwork yourself to keep low the chances of burning out.** <span style="color: #ff7f00;">**<span style="font-family: andale mono,times;"> -Yang**

As in, how are they selected, what sort of community is in each  house, etc.** <span style="font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">I had read that each house tends to have its own 'personality', and  the students joining that house tend to reflect that. Would you  agree/disagree, and how would you describe each of the houses'  characteristics?** <span style="font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Housing was just another topic that doesn't have much  first-hand coverage on the internet (at least, none that I've found).  However, I've also read that some of the processes behind the housing  are a bit hush-hush, and I would understand if you weren't really able  to share information.** <span style="font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">Thank you again for any answers you can give.**<span style="font-family: arial black,avant garde; color: #00bf00;">**<span style="font-size: 8pt;">-- D**

**<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;">Hey D,****<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;">You're right that the process involved in  Rotation is kept quiet. By Rotation, I refer to the first 2 weeks of  freshmen year, where students "rotate" through all the houses, where  they have a meal with the house residents (lunch or dinner) and are  given time to interact with them. The whole point of Rotation is for the  new student to get acquainted with the house culture. You have to  understand that it is unfair for the houses to carry stereotypes in new  students' minds without the students actually seeing what the house  culture is like for themselves. We try to keep the houses unbiased for  that reason. What I can tell is that students are temporarily situated  in one of the eight houses upon entering Caltech. After rotating through  the houses, they are given a sheet to rate the houses on a scale of  1-20 with 1 being the house they enjoy the most and 20 being the one  they really don't want to live in. ** **<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;">After that, behind closed doors, the eight house presidents and a  couple others convene and officially decide where to allocate the new  students. I cannot give you any information on how this is done neither  do I know how this is done since I haven't served in a capacity that  allowed me to make decisions on which house to put freshmen in. Also,  Rotation rules, which all Caltech students are subject to (like the  Honor Code) prevents me from going into further detail since violation  of the Rotation rules is akin to violating the Honor Code, which forms  the heart of how Caltech operates. You can read more on rotation rules  here: <a href="https://ihc.caltech.edu/rotationrules.html" target="_blank">https://ihc.caltech.edu/rotationrules.html</a>** **<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;">What I can tell you is a little about my own experience. I wasn't  put into my first house choice. However, if you come here, you will know  that at least 9 times out of 10, a student will be put into a house  where they can live happily and thrive in. Houses may have distinct  personalities, which you'll have to find for yourself once you get here,  but in all honesty, I think I can live in any of the eight houses  without a problem because they are *ALL *fine houses!** **<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;">With that being said, if you still feel that you belong more to  another house, you will be given the option to become a social or full  member of any of the eight houses. By becoming a full member, you can  even move off of your primary housing assignment and into that house of  which you are a full member. Of course, students rarely move out of the  house they are assigned unless there are extraordinary circumstances. I  hope that answers your question. ****<span style="color: #ff7f00; font-family: andale mono,times;"> -Yang**
