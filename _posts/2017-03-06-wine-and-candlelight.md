Fleming House has an annual Valentine's Day formal dinner called Wine and Candlelight. This year's dinner was my fourth and last Wine and Candlelight dinner. Many students go with dates, but it is not required and plenty of people go alone. The attire is formal, and people love to take pictures before the event.

The price is $35, which may seem expensive, but you get a four course meal, and wine is served to those of legal drinking age. There is a bartender who checks IDs. Additionally, there are two ways you can gofor free - you can help cook the meal or you can wait the meal. I opted to help cook, which was a lot of fun. The student waiters also had a good time.
