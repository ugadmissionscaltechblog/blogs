In each house, the upperclass counselors (UCCs) host an alley event each term. These are subsidized events that the UCC chooses, such as laser tag, going to a restaurant, bowling, paintball, horse riding, etc. Typically, each person in the house will choose one alley event that they want to go to, although you can attend multiple (you just won't get subsidized after the first one).

This term, I went to a comedy club alley event. I've never been to a professional comedy club, so it was pretty exciting. It lasted for 2 hours, with 5 or 6 comics performing. There were two comics who I didn't find funny, but the others were pretty good. I enjoyed it! I'd definitely be willing to go to more comedy clubs in the future :)
