*I'm leavin' on a jet plane,
**Don't know when I'll be back again
*
Vienna Teng - one of my favorite folk/pop artists - does a good cover of this song, originally by John Denver.

The lyrics are partially true because I actually don't know when I'll be back here, as I haven't booked my flight back in January yet.. should do that when I arrive home this weekend. 

Having cycled through LOTR too many times to count [the same with Harry Potter; think of what
you can do when snowed in at Lake Tahoe], I'm settling for this pretty
little package that came in the mail this week: 

 
Yes, girls can like Star Trek too. Some of us also play WoW, but Elaine hasn't taught me yet.

Our last day here at Tech before the new decade consisted of shopping, shopping, and ... more shopping? And dinner at In-N-Out, of course, because it's only found in the western side of the States.

Hats, gloves, our wool coats and boots, sweaters, and all sorts of warm weather gear for the east coast. Supposedly, the nighttime temperature here is the daytime temperature in D.C.: we'll update you on that one once we get there in less than 24 hours. Our shuttle leaves the Caltech Y at 5:30 am [yes, you read that time right] and we'll be at our place of stay, the William Penn House, at around 4 pm tomorrow.

Our plan for tonight is to pack, and then grab breakfast at IHOP [one of the only places nearby that's open 24 hours] at 4 before getting to the Y at 5. The general itinerary for the week is as follows:

Tuesday: Dinner with Caltech almuni
Wednesday: Monuments/Memorials/Museums Hopping, Department of Energy, NAS
Thursday: NIH, AAAS, The Pentagon
Friday: Breakfast with Michael Ledford, Lobbyist 

The next time you hear from us, we'll be on the other coast.

À Bientôt!
