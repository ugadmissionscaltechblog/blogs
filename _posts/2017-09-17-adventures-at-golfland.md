A friend from came up from Caltech for the weekend, so we decided to go to Golfland for a $9 unlimited arcade games + mini-golf package. Turns out, the unlimited arcade games were actually limited to non-ticket giving games, so we couldn't play much except pinball and mariokart, but we still had a good time.

We were pretty silly with our mariokart selfies, so it was a lot of fun.

After playing some games, we decided to try our hand at mini-golf. The course featured a lot of trick shots, like having to hit a ball through a small door in a lighthouse that opened and closed, or hitting the ball up a ramp into a set of rings, similar to skee-ball.

I have to say, there's definitely room for improvement in our mini-golfing skills.ðŸ˜›
