The Arts District is an artsy, up-and-coming area in DTLA. It's about a 20 minute drive without traffic. My friends and I went to Manuela, a Southern-style restaurant, for brunch. Manuela is located in the Hauser Wirth &amp; Schimmel art gallery. There is also a courtyard with cool art and chickens! We walked around the neighborhood after and checked out a small farmers' market, some boutique stores, and got coffee. Check out the pictures below. :)
