<span style="color: #bf5f00; font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: #bf5f00; font-size: 20px;">Happy (Belated) Halloween!!
So it's Fall term midterms week at Caltech, and what does that mean? That it's Halloween, of course! What better way to take a break from the grind of classes and exams than to dress up in crazy outfits and have fun with your friends?! Well...there isn't one so that's what I did. My Halloween has been pretty busy with a few different things going on, so let's get started!
Well...in my opinion an amazing way to spend All Hallow's Eve Eve is with your best friend watching movies and eating snacks, so that's what I did. Dannah and I (read: I) made some pumpkin pancakes to enjoy before having a movie marathon in the Braun "off-campus" house lounge. The movies we selected were "The Break Up" and "Election." Both were pretty different but entertaining (and NOT scary - I hate scary movies). And of course our snacks were delicious!

Fleming House had a pumpkin carving contest, so my alley (hallway) did our best effort to carve a good one. Well... if nothing else we at least had a fun time!

HOWEVER we got an honorable mention because the administrators who were judging really liked our design. I'm really proud of the Alley for working together - we had a blast!
However nothing is more important on El DÃ­a de los Muertos than DRESSING UP! Allison (remember the baseball game?) and I had a plan, but we needed to do some prep work before the big day.

Oh wait...I'm a senior, I don't have any midterms. Well all the more time to prepare for Duke on Tuesday!
