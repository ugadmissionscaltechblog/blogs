The seniors have less days than the frosh have term left. 

(Although technically done with work, we don’t officially graduate for another week) It’s been a whirlwind the past few weeks trying to finish my work, shipping boxes home, and begin saying goodbye to all the wonderful people at Caltech.

With the Admissions office, we had a great virtual farewell (the pic at the top) for all the seniors and everyone shared their best memories working together. My first memory interacting with admissions was my Junior (maybe Sophomore) year of high school when Jann came to my school for an information session, so I’ve known Jann for around 6 years now! 

Next Friday is our virtual Graduation which will be live-streamed online. There has been a good amount of drama related to having in-person graduation, but all the (vaccinated) graduating seniors and grad students are allowed to gather in the soccer field to watch the stream together in person. I’m going to be heading home to my family so I will be sipping on champagne from afar.

For me, I’m most excited to have a real break. The kind of break where I can stare at a wall and know that I have no responsibilities I’m procrastinating. I can’t think of the last break where I haven’t had some work from research, grad school applications, or anything else to worry about so I’m very excited to be able to relax. I’m heading off to Princeton in the fall to get my Ph.D. in Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering likely working on Fusion Reactors, so I’ve got to make the most of a break while I still can. 

If I’m not lazy, I’ll try to write another post about my best memories from Caltech, but for now, I’m signing off to go take a well-deserved nap.
