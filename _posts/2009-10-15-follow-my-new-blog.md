Hey Everyone!
Thank you so much for reading this blog about my summer internship and travel! I hope you enjoyed it!
Follow me on my new blog..."<a href="https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/class-in-session-eme-105/">Class in Session: E/ME 105</a>" where I will be blogging about the engineering course I am taking this term. The course is a continuation of the research project I began when I traveled to Guatemala this past summer. In addition, you can read about how I adjust to my busy senior year and get an inside look at what my life looks like when I'm at Caltech as opposed to a working in a different part of the country, or traveling to another part of the world!
