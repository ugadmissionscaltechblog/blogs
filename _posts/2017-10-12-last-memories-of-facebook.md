At the end of the 8th week of my internship, I went with my FBU buddy to visit Instagram HQ. Last year when I was in FBU, this building hadn't existed yet, as least not as Instagram HQ! Side note: FBU buddies is a program where past participants of FBU can be paired up with one or two current FBU-ers to help them get settled and give them advice on their projects.

Inside, there's a Blue Bottle Coffee, which not only has great coffee but also insanely good waffles. Would highly recommend! They also have a whole wall full of cute polaroids taken inside the shop.

Near the entrance, there are three themed areas, which seem to be purely tourist attractions for people to take photos in...including me.

On my last day as a Facebook intern, I was a proper tourist and went back to Instagram and the like sign to take photos ;D Bye Facebook!
