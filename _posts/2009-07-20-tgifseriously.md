I am not going to sugarcoat it---this past week at work was beyond intense...and my brain officially hurts.

On Tuesday morning, I turned on my laptop and proceeded to begin my work day when I realized that I was having extreme difficulty controlling the cursor on the screen...even when I wasn't touching the mouse, the cursor kept automatically veering off the screen towards the upper right hand corner. Thinking it was just a small glitch with the mouse, I tried ignoring it and kept moving the cursor around to try to open up my office e-mail and work documents. I failed immensely, and decided to ask around my cube farm for help. My work-mates puzzled, computer restarted, and mouse replaced--I decided to take matters into my own hands and walk my laptop over to the IT department in Building 20. After getting temporarily lost on my way to IT, I handed my computer over and explained the phantom cursor situation. We fired up the laptop...and lo and behold: the mouse was back in perfect working condition. Aaaargh!

In terms of real work---I have spent the past week theoretically solving and then coding the math model for the pressure compensation system. Since I needed a way to organize my thoughts, I decided to take my process to the whiteboard in my hexicle. After a few hours and multiple iterations, I finally found my solution!

Next I had to work on writing up the actual code. I decided to create the code in MathCad, a software used for documenting engineering/scientific calculations. I actually have never used the program before my time here at Schlumberger, and therefore had to learn on my own.

I hit an instant roadblock as I was trying to install MathCad. I was bombarded with error after error:

"The license you have requested contains an error" "Please specify a location of the product license" "Program already installed, would you like to repair or remove the program"

I just wanted to use the program--not repair or remove it!....my frustration resulted in my second encounter with IT in one week.

The end of my week went really well---I presented my progress on my math model to my manager, and got positive feedback and a "good job!"--It was definitely a confidence boost for me. I also received a docking station from my administrative assistant so that I could finally plug in my laptop and use a nicer monitor. It was a nice mental break for me to set-up my new workstation after such a hectic week.

Hope y'all had a productive week like I did...and are just as psyched as I am for the weekend!
