Good morning everyone!
This morning, we had a fake ditch day in Fleming House. Andrew and I have been planning out or "Price is Right"-themed stack all week...and woke up early to set it up and awaken the underclassmen along with the other seniors in our house. So here is our fake ditch day stack 2 of the year in pictures...

This week was a bit tiring for me. It included a career fair and multiple yoga and dance classes....oh and tons of reading applications for admissions. I am so excited for this weekend though--I've got my plans already made :D...and it includes Lloyd Interhouse!
Enjoy your weekend!
