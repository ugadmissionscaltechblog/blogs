On Saturday, my house had a social event at the Santa Anita Race Track. If you're not familiar with the Santa Anita Race Track, it is the race track at which Seabiscuit raced. It was a beautiful day, about 80 degrees out, and we had a great time.

I didn't realize how many devoted fans there were for horse racing. I guess if I were betting money on a winning horse, I might be more devoted, too. Near the end of every race the crowd would get very rowdy, sounding almost like the crowd during the last minute of a close basketball game. They got pretty intense.

The jockeys were so tiny! They have strict size requirements, being under 126 lbs. including their equipment. They typically range from 4'10" to 5'6", though there is no height requirement.

This guy in the polka dots actually won his race. It was a great race; he was in 3rd or 4th place on the home stretch, then shot out to first place. It was really cool to watch.

Overall, it was a great day. There were a lot of food trucks, in the center of the race track. I'm not sure I've seen so many food trucks in my life. My friend watches "The Great Food Truck Race," and actually recognized one of the food trucks from that show, Nonna's Kitchenette. It was great to get off campus, especially because the Santa Anita Park is only about 20 minutes from Tech and tickets were as low as $5 per person. I may be a sophomore, but I do get out some, too :).
