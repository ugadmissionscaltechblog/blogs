Hi everyone,

Since we are off to a new term and new year, a few of my friends and I decided to make dumplings. I believe I mentioned making dumplings last term in one of my posts, but this time, we made our own dumpling skins from scratch. Our filling consisted of napa cabbage, ground pork, mushrooms, daikon, and bean thread noodles. They turned out really well if I may so myself. We pan-fried half of them and then steamed the rest. We folded so many that we had plenty leftover for the next couple days.

Do you have any new year’s resolutions? I know a lot of people make new year’s resolutions, but I personally don’t because I believe that if I want to make a change in my life, it should start today, not tomorrow, not next year. Nonetheless, I hope that I’ll be able to finish up at Tech well and can’t wait to see what 2014 has in store. For instance, I’ll be travelling (along with five other Techers) later this month to King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) in Saudi Arabia for an International Undergraduate Research Poster Competition. This is an exciting opportunity and we’ll be able to interact with students, scientists, faculty, and entrepreneurs from all around the globe. For those who don’t know, Caltech’s President Emeritus Jean Lou Chameau is currently the President of KAUST. We hope to get a chance to see him during our stay in Saudi Arabia.

In addition to KAUST, I’ll also be awaiting graduate school decisions and going on visits this term. Everyone asks where I’ll be next year, but I honestly do not know. I bet you high school seniors awaiting college decisions can empathize. Part of me feels nervous, yet part of me feels excited about the uncertainty of my future. However, my applications are all submitted and now all I can do is sit back, relax, wait patiently, and enjoy the rest of my senior year with my fellow peers.
