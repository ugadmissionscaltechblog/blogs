Hey everyone!
I'm finally back in the states after spending 9 days in Guatemala---what an adventure! I didn't have any substantial access to internet or time to blog---so I will be blogging about my travel from the comfort of my home in San Diego.

The first few days of the trip were spent seeing the workshops where some people in the group would go to work/observe in the following days of the trip. First, we visited a small roadside brick/tile workshop where there were a few men mixing mud for the bricks with their feet and molding and shaping them into perfect bricks that would dry in the sun and then be fired in a big oven. They make about 800 individual bricks a day and work from 5am to 9am so they can work before the sun heats up.

We had dinner at a small restaurant, walked around Central Park at night and partied at a salsa club until super late.

More to come....
