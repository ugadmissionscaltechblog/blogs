While there are a lot of perks about Facebook, one of the coolest is a deal that they have with SFMOMA. Any Facebook employee who brings their badge can get free general admission to the museum. It doesn’t include special exhibitions, but there’s so many exhibits in the first place; as long as you like modern art, you’ll find your cup of tea.

Although I say that, I did buy the special exhibition ticket. But I couldn’t help it, the exhibit was on Rene Magritte, one of my favorite artists. If you haven’t heard his name, you might know him from the famous bowler hat men. I love his subversion of expectations the most, like in his paintings “Le Vol” or “L’Invention Collectif”.

This exhibit was on Magritte’s later years, when his iconic bowler hats were a recurring motif. In addition, they had one of my favorite series, The Human Condition and its related paintings. I think the seamless blending of the canvas with the background is really innovative.
