<p style="color: #ff00ff;"><span style="color: #000000; ">Hope you all had a wonderful Christmas!
One of the things my family takes for granted here in SD during the holidays is the popular Christmas Card Lane. We live less than a mile away---and have to drive right past it to get out of our neighborhood...so we see it everyday, every holiday season..so to us, it's nothing super extraordinary anymore. But for you all who aren't from here...:)
Christmas Card Lane is a holiday light display that snakes through a bunch of residential neighborhoods in Rancho Penasquitos in SD. People come from all over SD county (and out of town too!) to walk the streets and see the beautifully decorated houses with large (plywood) Christmas cards on every front lawn. It is really a spectacular sight to see...There are many people walking the streets, caroling, and even horse drawn carriages that are brought out at night. 
So if you're ever in SD during the holiday season...definitely see it---it's up usually right after Thanksgiving until New Year's!
