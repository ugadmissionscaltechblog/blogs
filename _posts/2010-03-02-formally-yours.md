Good evening. I'm Andrew, and I'll be your host tonight as you visit Fleming Formal Dinner....OK so unfortunately I can't actually send you over the food we ate at our delicious formal meal, but I can definitely tell you about it! Each term, every House gets to have one formal meal, and it's so fun to dress up and get to eat some gourmet food. Ours was last Friday, and it's so nice to see everyone dust off their suit or go out to buy new dresses for the occasion. What's also really cool is that we can invite not only our fellow students from other Houses, but also professors, post-docs, grad students, even alums or the Deans! It's really neat to have a forum where you can informally talk with those in charge of your education at Caltech, and it's also nice to see them outside of their class/lab/offices. Sometimes they even bring their families, and the young blood makes it even more fun!
What was on the menu (since I'm always concerned with the food, of course). Well, here 'goes!
Fillet mignon with brazed oxtail served over polenta cakes and seasonal vegetables
Cornish game hen with port balsamic sauce with carrot and turnip puree and garlic roasted Brussels sprouts
Winter vegetable pave with Spanish romesco sauce
Dessert: Chocolate Guinness cake with Irish cream sabayon
Yum! I had the vegetarian entr√©e (because it was a Friday during Lent), and everyone said their food was delicious. And chocolate cake for dessert can never be a mistake. ...Picture time!
