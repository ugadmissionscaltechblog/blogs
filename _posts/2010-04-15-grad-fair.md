Today we had the Grad Fair in front of the bookstore for all the soon-to-be graduates.

I picked up my formal Graduation Invitation and some order forms for diploma frames and official announcements. I also got to take my senior portrait with my cap and gown!---(hope it turns out good!) I picked up my red cap and gown a few days earlier from the bookstore so I could hang it up and steam out the wrinkles for the picture (It's a tradition that members of Fleming House may graduate in their house color, red if they wish).

All of the excitement today got me super excited about graduation! It's just around the corner!
