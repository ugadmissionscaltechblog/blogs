Hey Everyone,
Just wanted to touch base before my crazy weekend started...It's going to be soo exciting with lots of events (see below!) and rehearsals.

Since the dance show is fast approaching--next weekend!...one of the dances I'm in (I guess I'll call it...the Korean Pop Genie Dance) will also be performing at the Annual Team Tech Talent Show tomorrow night (this Saturday) so we can get used to staging the dance. It's been pretty hard to coordinate with 9 girls---we all have busy schedules! But every night this past week we've been practicing together and solidifying our formations. 
We also got our high heeled pumps that are part of our costumes this past week---and we have been struggling doing our choreography in them. But we won't be able to get it down unless we wear them from now until the show(s)---OUCH!
This weekend involves this talent show performance, more dance rehearsals, cognitive psychology homework...and the PASADENA COLLEGE FIELD TOURNAMENT! I'm actually off to a team practice right now for this exciting tournament which will take place tomorrow at the Rose Bowl. The 5 colleges in Pasadena will be competing tomorrow in various events---such as Monster Croquet, Cheeseburger Challenge, Pasadena Puzzle, etc.

I was just named to this 20 person team a few days ago, and have been busy getting ready for the event! Here is the press release made earlier last week in the [Pasadena Star News](https://www.pasadenastarnews.com/ci_14770977). I will be competing in a few different events---but specializing in what will be known as the "Uniform Challenge." All I can disclose at the moment is that it involves our Beaver mascot, and crazy Einstein hair :) I'll be sure to fill you guys in!
