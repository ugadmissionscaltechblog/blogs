<a href="https://www.instagram.com/eatwanderlust/">Wanderlust Creamery</a> has one of the best artisanal ice creams in LA. To celebrate the new season of Game of Thrones they came out with some Game of Thrones inspired flavors. My friends and I went to go check it out even though some of us weren't GoT fans. While the GoT flavors were specials, they have other more permanent flavors that are even more amazing!

They make everything in house, including the cones. They have ube (purple yam) cones and were making them while we were there.

We sampled every flavor they had and my goodness it was hard to decide. The Jasmine and Apricot, Mango Sticky Rice and Earl Grey were hits amongst the ice-cream lovers. The "FIRE + BLOOD INSPIRED BY: ESSOS, ACROSS THE NARROW SEA" and "DRAGON GLASS INSPIRED BY: THE WALL" were the GoT flavors that drew me in. These two were sorbets which were slightly lighter. Fire + Blood is "made from dragonfruit, blood orange, + serrano chili" and Dragon Glass is "Darkest chocolate + Old Rasputin Russian Imperial Stout".

They also have a variety of toppings to choose from. I am a minimalist in some ways so I skipped, but look at all the choices!

If you sign up for their rewards program, you can come back the next day for a free scoop. My friend signed up, and for me it's only a matter of time. I think Wanderlust is my favorite ice cream place now, tied with Scoops. I will be back soon!
