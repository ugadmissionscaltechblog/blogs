I’m Bhavana, Prefrosh from sunny Folsom, California. To be honest, I was expecting Caltech to be much smaller, and, well, more nerdy. What I found was an amazingly friendly campus, with amazing programs and institutions and people and opportunities. It’s only my first day here, but already I can see myself going here! The turtle pond was cute- and my little brother now REALLY wants me to go here, so I can get him a turtle from the pond :) (I can’t, but I’m not going to tell him that just yet). As an artist and dancer and lover of all things science, I fee perfectly at home here and have met other awesome prefrosh and current students...my future college buddies? Probably!
Go beavers!!!!!!
