On Sunday morning, when I left my dorm to go get lunch, I saw a friend longboarding back carrying a soda in a yellow cup in his right hand and a bag in his left. The soda cup, I recognized quickly, was from Which Wich, a sandwhich chain that recently opened a location on Lake Avenue.

From Google Maps

Getting to Which Which is easy!

I personally enjoy getting the humus sandwhich with:

- whole wheat bread
- blue cheese
- sliced hard boiled egg
- sriracha
- spinach
- cucumber
- bell peppers
- sauerkraut
- jalapenos
- tomatoes
- extra garlic
- pepper

The goal is to include as many ingredients known for their bad-breath causing properties as possible. Kidding.

I really like strong food! Give me the sour and the spicy! The key with Which Wich is to order ahead using their online ordering form because the line can be long sometimes. All in all, this chain is definitely not a Subway knock-off.
