It is currently 1:21 in the morning and I am thrilled to be writing the first post of our new admissions blog, Caltech Fission. For those of you who didn’t follow the old blog, it’s nice to meet you. My name is Andrew and I’m a senior at Caltech studying geophysics and English literature. 

Throughout this summer, our local webmaster Brian (EE ’23) has been working on a new website for our old Caltech admissions blog “Theory of Connection” and we’re thrilled to finally be able to share it with you.

We’ll be posting a bit more on the specific development process of the blog in the upcoming weeks, but for now we wanted to take a second to reflect on the unprecedented times we’re living through and introduce you to Caltech Fission. For better or for worse, we’re living through arguably the most historic time in recent US history. As writer’s it is ever important to catalog and reflect on the unique experiences of the modern world under COVID-19. 

Caltech students as a general have done a lot during the quarantine period. We’ve worked remote internships. We’ve developed social distancing solutions. We’ve slept too much and exercised too little. We’ve baked cakes, hiked mountains, and failed to recreate TikTok. We’ve enjoyed online classes and we’ve missed our friends. Times are different, but we’re still the same people at the heart of it all. We’re all living through unprecedented times, each in our own Caltech-y ways.

And so be warned: our new blog is more than just a stylistic change. We have new content. New bloggers. New styles. COVID-19 has dramatically impacted all of our lives in different ways, and for this next term, whether we’re at home with our parents, Puerto Vallarta (some of my friends are actually renting a house out there for fall term), or out in LA, we’re looking forward to sharing our stories with you. Hopefully, in the process, you’ll gain a better understanding of Caltech and what it means to be a Caltech student.

So, stay tuned for some old updates, some new faces, and some good vibes! 
I’ll end with a quote from Raymond Carver: “I could hear my heart beating. I could hear everyone's heart. I could hear the human noise we sat there making, not one of us moving, not even when the room went dark.” The rest will be left as an exercise for the reader.
