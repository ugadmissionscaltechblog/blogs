My roommate and I discovered a shared love of sweet things - cookies, cupcakes, ice cream, pastries, etc. If it's sweet, we will probably like it. So it's no surprise that we both have baked before. When we discovered this, we made a pact to bake at some point while we were living together.

Two weeks in, and we decided it was time to bake something. But what? After much hemming and hawing, and hours looking at Buzzfeed Tasty videos, we decided on "Actually The Best Chewy Chocolate Chip Cookies Ever". Because the apartment was empty of all supplies, we went shopping for the essentials. It's surprising that baking ingredients are so cheap - even after getting everything we needed (plus a few extra cravings like ice cream mochi) it was only around $35.

Working together, we were able to make the dough in record time. Somehow, we restrained ourselves from eating all of the cookie dough or baking it straight away, and let it sit like the recipe suggested. What a torturous hour it was! But finally we were able to put the dough in the oven, and out came 6 beautiful cookies. Crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and a hint of chewiness.

Considering we have so much extra of all of the ingredients, you can expect us to do much more baking before we part ways :)
