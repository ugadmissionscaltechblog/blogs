This year, there was a superbloom in California because of all the rain we got from December to February. During spring break, three friends and I went to Anza-Borrego state park near San Diego to see the wildflowers. It's about a 2 hour drive away from Caltech, and on the way, we saw flowers dotting the hills along the highway. Some hills were orange from all the California Poppies, while others were yellow and purple.

Since Anza-Borrego is a desert, the types of wildflowers that bloomed there were different from the ones we saw on the way. The flowers at Anza-Borrego tended to be small (about a size of a quarter) and were typically yellow or white. There were some occasional apricot and lavender colored flowers as well!
Next to the visitor center was a garden featuring some of the flora in the state park, including cacti that were blooming with pink flowers.

A couple minutes drive away from the town were these huge metal statues of various animals. The most impressive was the dragon below!

After driving around the park, we went on a 2 hour hike to a small oasis where there were native palm trees and a little spring. Here are some photos from the hike :)
