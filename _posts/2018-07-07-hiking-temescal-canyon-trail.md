Temescal Canyon lies in the Santa Monica Mountains, right next to the beach and about an hour away from Caltech. The trail itself is a 3 mile loop, with 860 ft elevation gain. After climbing to the top, we could see the Pacific ocean!

Afterwards, the trail heads back down towards a small waterfall, and into a valley with a lot of colorful flowers :)

After the hike, we went to Pasta Sisters, which was featured on Buzzfeed's Worth It series. I got the black truffle sauce withpappardelle, and it was really tasty! I would definitely go back to try the gnocchi and another sauce.
