Every now and then, ASCIT puts on small social events for students to go and do something off-campus. Last term there was a Color-Me-Mine excursion; groups of students were chosen by lottery to go to a session at a place called Color-Me-Mine, where groups can go and paint, chat, snack, and even drink if they are old enough (this would depend on what was reserved for the group though). They either paint something on a canvas (like a landscape or a still life) or they paint pottery.

This term, they arranged a lottery for an Escape Room game hosted at Fox in a Box Escape Room LA. I was lucky enough to get picked for the event; I’ve been to a few different rooms before, and the experience is always enjoyable. This time, a small team of us (six people) went into a room called Central Bank Heist. Its goal was as you might think: to steal a bunch of diamonds from a bank.

The fun thing was that the room was in the dark, so we were given flashlights to explore everything. I’m not exactly fond of the dark, so if I was venturing along in the room, it was somewhat spooky. However, I’m also a scaredy cat, and refuse to watch any horror movies. Even so, the darkness wasn’t that hard, and the puzzles were really fun to try and figure out (although we weren’t above getting hints to be able to complete the room). In the end, we had only 3 minutes left by the time we got the diamonds - but we still completed it! That’s something to be proud of.
