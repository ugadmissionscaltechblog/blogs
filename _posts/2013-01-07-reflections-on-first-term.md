Winter break flew by almost as fast as first term, and when I come to think about it, a ton happened during my first exposure to college.I learned how to write mathematical proofs, program in Python, and much more knowledge through my classes. With a set due every week, by the end of ten weeks you really learn a lot! In addition to academics, I also adjusted to college life this first term, getting used to doing my own laundry and being away from home. But even with all of this, the biggest thing I'm taking from first term is the friends/connections I've made. I could tell my friend whom I've known for weeks at Caltech something I wouldn't be comfortable saying to someone I've known for years. I've found people that are like me,which makes them so much easier to relate to and become close friends with. In addition, many of us now share experiences and similar perspectives.

In just ten weeks, Caltech has caused me to change significantly. I've begun to actually enjoy solving problems, set goals and accomplish them in time, and my priorities have shifted to favor academics more. (Much growth also comes from living away from home I think.)
And now another term is about to start.It's daunting to think about the endless list of tasks in front of me: finding a SURF, doing well in tennis and school. Eleven more terms to go at Caltech, then grad school?! It seems like a lot now, and is totally overwhelming, but I reassure myself that the time will fly by as first term has. And ideally I'll keep on learning new things and changing at this rate.

Thank you for reading my blog! I hope you enjoyed reading about my experiences as a frosh at Caltech as much as me living it.
