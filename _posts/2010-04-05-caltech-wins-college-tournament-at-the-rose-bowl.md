Yep---you read right! The Caltech Team totally DOMINATED at the Rose Bowl in the Pasadena College Field Tournament. It was probably one of the most exciting things I have been a part of during my entire 4 years at Caltech. :D
The 20 person team met Saturday morning at the Rose Bowl to compete against 5 other colleges in multiple events: including the Uniform Challenge, Cheeseburger Challenge, Monster Croquet, Blind Faith, Frisbee Golf, Meteor Catch, Pasadena Puzzle. We either placed in first or second place in all the events :). We had the most fans show up for us in the stands (students, faculty, professors, etc), wearing matching orange t-shirts to support the team.

The event I was responsible for was the Uniform Challenge, though I participated in the Blind Faith and Pasadena Puzzle....and cheered my team on on the sidelines during the other events. 
I have a ton of pictures that I took...I think it'll give you a better understanding of what went down.
