Hi everybody!!

This is my first time blogging for Admissions and I am super excited about it! So first off, let me introduce myself :)My name is Lori and I am a frosh in Ruddock House. You could consider me to be super girly, and I love fashion and the color pink. I'm planning on double majoring in Planetary Science and Philosophy. Random facts: according to the enrollment figures for 2010-2011 (last school year), there were three Planetary Science majors, and zero Philosophy majors. Kinda scary doing stuff that not a lot of people have done before!

I guess I'm not the average Techer in that I don't want to pursue research. I want to be a science journalist because I LOVE writing and reading. My biggest dream is to work for National Geographic! My second biggest dream is to be a high school teacher... so I get a lot of people asking, "Why did you even come here?"

Don't get me wrong: I LOVE SCIENCE. I have tons of fun doing physics sets (sets = homework) and various other Techy things. But it's important to remember that not everyone at Caltech does math/science/engineering 24/7. For me personally, it's extremely important to have a balance between "left-brained" activities, and "right-brained" ones. I won't lie, sometimes doing math and physics all the time is super overwhelming and tiring.

In order to keep my right-brained sanity, I make time to do yoga, read (not textbooks), do artsy stuff, dance, and write. Of course, in an average week there's no way I'd be able to do ALL of that! But I find that taking a moment to stop and do something I love (other than science of course!) is super relaxing to my mind and soul.

In the next few weeks I'll be writing all about the fun adventures and escapades that go on at Caltech, and also about how to keep a healthy balance between work and play. Thanks for taking the time to stop by!

Love,

Lori
