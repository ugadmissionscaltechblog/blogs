Hi Everyone,
If you've been keeping up with the news here on campus..you probably know that Ditch Day occurred last Friday, May 21st. I am happy to say it was such a success, and my stack came together perfectly and and easily during the days that lead up to it. Andrew and I are planners...and definitely were super organized way in advance so we were able to manage everything to get done in time and the way we envisioned it. 
I have no regrets---I got to put all the things I wanted in my stack and was so happy to see it come to life and happen on ditch day :). This past weekend, I have been recuperating and fighting off the beginnings of a cold. I guess my body does that after finals weeks...it kinda breaks down from exhaustion. 
Anyway...Andrew said he would blog about all the stuff that happened on Ditch Day...while I wanted to post pictures from some of the preparation I made during the week leading up to it :)
