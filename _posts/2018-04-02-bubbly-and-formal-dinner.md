In Page, we have an event called Bubbly to celebrate the last day of classes. This year, our grill team made banh mi for everyone! Everyone was talking in the courtyard, so it was great to just hang out and chill.

Our grill team also has Midnight Wieners once a term, which is an event that only a senior can decide. It happens when a senior decides that that night's dinner is so bad that we need to have hot dogs at midnight the same day. Immediately afterwards, the social team goes to Pavilions to buy hot dogs, buns, and chips, and brings it to the grill team for them to prepare.
