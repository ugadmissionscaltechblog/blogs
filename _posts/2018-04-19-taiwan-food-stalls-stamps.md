Blogging on my travel before and after study abroad is long overdue -- at the start of my journey, I flew from the US to Singapore, then Taiwan, then Bruges, and finally Cambridge. My blog posts on Singapore are up, so time to start with Taiwan!
Taiwan isn't Taiwan without its variety of food -- shops on the side of the street, food carts, proper restaurants, and more. On our first day, we got delicious boba tea from this super aesthetic shop.

On another day, we stopped by a street cart to buy green onion pancakes :) We've actually come to this cart for years, and she's always here!

We also passed by this street for lunch -- it's a whole street of food stalls, famous for their pork!
