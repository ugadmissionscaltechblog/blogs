My favorite udon place of all time is Marugame Monzo in Little Tokyo. I found out about it in my freshman year, and I've never been disappointed! This is what the main street of Little Tokyo looks like:

The yellow storefront is Daikokuya, a famous ramen place, and right next to it is Marugame Monzo. There are always long lines for both places -- you can even see from the photo that there are a bunch of people waiting outside. Typically, I've had to wait somewhere from 30 min to an hour to get inside Marugame. I haven't been to this particular Daikokuya, but I went to another one closer to Caltech, and the wait was also around 30 minutes to an hour.

The interior of Marugame looks like this:

In the back of the restaurant, you can see the chefs cutting the udon noodles that are going to be served to you!

My favorite dishes to order are the curry udon (sometimes with extra noodles) and the beef udon. I got the curry udon this time, and my boyfriend got the duck nanban udon. He also likes the squid mentai butter udon.

I love this restaurant!! I'd highly recommend going if you ever get the chance.
