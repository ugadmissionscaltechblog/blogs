The week after Ditch Day, a few of my close friends in my year and I took an overnight trip to my hometown, San Diego. We left at 10:30 in the morning and arrived in Old Town San Diego sometime into the noon hour. We had lunch at a classy Mexican restaurant, Cafe Guadalajara--I'd forgotten how much more Mexican food there is in SD than LA.

Besides the beautiful exterior, they had gorgeous decorations inside:

And outside:

I'd never seen real papel picado (decorative tissue paper crafts) before!

We were served fresh chips and salsa for an appetizer...

Here are the faces of some soon-to-be college graduates on a weekend getaway to one of the most relaxing cities on earth!

I have always had a fondness for chicken flautas (seasoned ground chicken in a crispy golden flour tortilla skin, almost like a spring roll), and these were on point:

After lunch, we went to the Coronado peninsula...

And relaxed by the beach.

The sand at Coronado has little golden flecks of pyrite:

We went scrambling over some rocks by the ocean:

Coronado is also known for its historic hotel/beach resort, which is called the Hotel Del Coronado and has been frequented by celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe:

We couldn't resist taking a mirror picture in the beautiful hallways:

There are a variety of stores below the lobby floor. The candy store sold candy sea glass,ice cream cone gummies, in addition to fudge and truffles and other ordinary things like little seal dolls on lollipops.

The Del is a curious mix of historic architecture, ocean, old-fashioned seaside resort, modern shops and bars, and the desert-ocean landscape unique to Southern California. It was as gorgeous outside as it was inside:
