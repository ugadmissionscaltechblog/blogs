My laundry is all folded and put away. I did all the dishes. It's that kind of week. I woke up early yesterday to start a procedure in lab. We wanted to make the job take 1 day instead of the usual 2. (The deal was that I go in early and leave a little early and my coworker goes in at the normal time and stays to the normal time.) I like operating on a regular sleeping schedule, but I'm willing to shift things around to make the magic happen.

It's been a long week, so last night, I was too exhausted when I got off work at 4 pm. I slept hard until 6 pm, and then a friend asked if I wanted to go to Chipotle. I really didn't feel like it, but I put on a weather-inappropriate hoodie to go with my PJ pants and went. I started feeling better about halfway through my burrito.

I still didn't feel like biking or doing anything very demanding, so I put on fuzzy pink socks and poured myself a glass of club soda in my T.S. Eliot mug.

I'm pretty sure my socks are from here: https://www.amazon.com/Plush-Multi-Color-Thick-Striped/dp/B0062PIR8Y/ref=sr_1_13?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1406225598&amp;sr=8-13&amp;keywords=fuzzy+socks

I highly recommend the socks.

My mug is from the Barnes and Noble in my hometown, but it's also available here: https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/home-gift-jeff-fisher-ts-eliot-quote-mug/23720135

What ought one do after one has donned comfy socks and outfitted oneself with a soothing beverage?

Computer games.

I haven't played any computer game since my senior year of high school. (Back then I was playing Portal and Starcraft Wings of Liberty.) I do enjoy them, but I am usually more likely to curl up with a book. I started playing Mini Ninja, a cute casual game I got from[Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/). I found it pretty relaxing. It took a while to get it working on my laptop, which just runs Linux right now. I used to dual boot Windows, but found switching too tiresome. I use Wine software to run any Windows programs I want, and PlayOnLinux is apparently pretty good for playing games on Steam.

I needed yesterday night to recharge my batteries a little. I find working in a biology lab to be really exhausting at times, but it is rewarding.
