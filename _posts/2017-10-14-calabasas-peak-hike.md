The Calabasas Peak Trail is in the Santa Monica Mountains, where there a lot of great hiking trails. It's a 4.5 mile round trip trek, with about half of it on a small trail through tall grasses, bushes, and small trees, and the other half on a more open path. It was a really hot day when we went hiking, but it was fun!

You can get peeks of the surrounding view as you hike.

We hiked for about 2-2.5 hours total, heading back down as the sun was setting.
