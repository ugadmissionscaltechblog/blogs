We decided to take
the scenic route to Lugano, the next city we were staying in. First, we took a
train to Luzerne. We had an hour to kill before our boat ride across the lake,
so we stopped by a modern art museum e that had some weird exhibits and some
really weird exhibits. There were a few that we just thought were stupid, but a
few were pretty cool. One we really liked was a room with two guys continuously
painting the walls. One painting them white, the other painting them black.

Seriously. For all the days the exhibit was open They were always approximately
at opposite corners, so the room was half white and half black.. I couldnâ€™t
help but laugh every time I thought of it.

After the museum, we
got on our boat and took a last look at Lugano before leaving the dock.

The cruise across
Lake Lugano was a great experience. Even though it was raining, it was
incredibly beautiful.

There were waterfalls cascading down, swans swimming in
the water, and the lake itself was a deep teal.

Tall mountains
surrounded the lake, and their tops were hidden by the clouds, which made them
seem like they stretched upwards forever.

One of our fellow
passengers was from Korea, so it was a nice chance for me to use some of my
Korean again.

Here is the picture
he took of me on the boat, after the rain had stopped.

We arrived in our
port and said goodbye to the boat.

Before we caught the
train to Lugano, we say a stone car just sitting out with no explanation. I
guess it was just public artwork?

When we arrived in
Lugano, we splurged for a nice dinner since we were pretty under budget on
food. It was the most delicious minestrone and tiramisu I have ever had.

We had
thin pizza for our entre. It was yummy, but difficult to eat since we had to
cut it into bite size pieces instead of slices. Since Lugano is in the Italian
part of Switzerland, we had some trouble communicating with the waiter and we
accidentally ordered water instead of specifying tap water.

This meant we got a
fancy corked bottle of Arkina water with matching glasses for over USD $10! And
we were sitting literally 10 feet away from a free public water fountain whose
water tasted exactly the same as the bottled variety. We went back to our
hostel, where we shared a room with 14 other men and women and a coed bathroom
with 30 other people. We sat in the common room for a while and socialized with
the people there. We met some nice women who gave us advice about good things
to go see while we were in Lugano.
