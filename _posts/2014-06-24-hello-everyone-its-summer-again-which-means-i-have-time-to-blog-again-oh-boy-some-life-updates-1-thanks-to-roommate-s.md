Hello everyone! It's summer again, which means I have time to blog [once more](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/unlimited-food-works/), oh boy.

Some life updates:

1. Thanks to roommate S's awesome picks, we got a huge room! With a loft build by previous inhabitants! Thanks, roommate S!

2. Living off campus caused our food stockpile to reach unmanageably large proportions. Please send help. It took 3+ hours to organize that cabinet...

3. Yup, we're still getting our [food box delivery](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2013/08/a-summer-of-fresh-produce-draft-.html).

4. [Green onions](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2013/09/green-onion-farm.html) have the surprising ability to stay alive even when their owner forgot to water them for 2+ weeks. They've been sitting in the SoCal summer sun, too...

5. ????
With that said, welcome (back?) to Unlimited Food Works. The anime content will probably rise by 150% from before, so please consider yourself warned. (Don't worry though, there'll still be food posts!)
