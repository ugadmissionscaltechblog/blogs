Before heading to study abroad in Cambridge, I travelled to Singapore, Taiwan, and Bruges. On the flight to Singapore, I got to ride the Eva Air Sanrio plane! All the decorations inside are Sanrio/Hello Kitty themed, including the pillowcases, the in flight entertainment welcome screen, napkins, and even the toilet paper.

When I arrived, I was greeted with great peking duck (thanks so much!!):

Then, I went to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Fun fact: it is the only tropical garden to be named a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It's very large, with different sections including an orchid garden, an area featuring plants used for medicine, an educational dinosaur-themed area, and an open park for picnics.

There were a lot of interesting ferns and tropical plants around.

I didn't get to go to the orchid garden section this time since it was near closing, but I got to eat great Hainan chicken rice instead. It was actually the best chicken rice I've ever had. Guess you can't find this in LA :P
