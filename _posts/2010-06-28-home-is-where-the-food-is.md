Hey guys,So, I'm lucky enough to live relatively close to Tech--home for me is about three hours north of Pasadena. Ever since this summer began, I've needed stuff andhave been too lazy to get it on my own. So, a few weeks ago I told my mom that she should come down and buy me stuff. I mean, that's what moms are for...right? :) Initially I was just going to stay here, but then some people said this would be the perfect opportunity to learn how to make Mexican food. Haha..and I agreed. And thus, my tamale-making weekend was set.Since the only full day I would be home was Saturday, this was my tamale making day. Before we started, my mom went and showed me what to buy. Here's a picture of some of the raw materials. Actually, most of the items were used for the preparation of the meat. Apparently, you "need" to prepare it yourself in order for it taste better. Yumm.

After letting the meat heat up a bit, we added in the chili sauce. According to my mom, this was the "cheating" way because we didn't make it ourselves. Pshh, it was perfectly fine with me. I'm a college student. Time is money and the less time it takes to make the food, the better!
