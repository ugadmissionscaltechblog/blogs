So throughout the summer, weâ€™ve had these sporadic intern boat parties, where 200 interns get on a boat, sail around Lake Washington, blasting music. So around 2 PM on Sunday, we started lining up to board the boat (we being my team, a few other Caltech interns, and me). Once we made it onto the boat, we started exploring. There were two decks, the bottom deck was where all of the food and beverages were, and it also had a pretty sick dance floor. The DJ was bumping all of the hottest tracks from back when I was in middle school. The upper deck had a covered area for seating and an open area where there were just gorgeous views of the Seattle downtown area. We spent about four hours circling Seattle on the boat, meeting other interns, hanging out with other full-time employees, talking to our recruiters, busting a move, eating all of the food, and generally having a good time. 10/10. Would boat party again. The theme for this boat party was Hawaiian Tropicana, so we were all handed leis once we boarded the boat. I made mine into a really ill-fitting flower crown that flew after about thirty seconds. Here are some cute pics of the squad:
