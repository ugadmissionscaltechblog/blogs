The first week at Caltech can be best described as a whirlwind of new faces, exciting campus events, spontaneous fun activities, late-night chats, problem set-induced stress, and of course free food! It seems like only yesterday that all of the freshmen arrived at Caltech with a question more urgent than problems in math or physics: What house were they going to live in? Well the week of Rotation is almost over and the answer to this question will be revealed tomorrow! Hooray!
Although I enjoyed mingling with the pre-frosh and meeting about forty new people every day, I must admit by the end of the week not only was I exhausted but I was running out of interesting questions to ask the pre-frosh! Starting tomorrow, I can finally relax and catch up on the TV shows I missed. Oh wait…that is, once I finish the stack of problem sets on my desk. That is alright. It is all worth it to get the pre-frosh acclimated to Caltech, through all the houses, and finally into their proper House.

On a different note, the Caltech Fall Career Fair is coming up at the end of this month! If you have been on one of the Caltech tours, maybe you know we stress how awesome our career fairs are!In addition to just having fun shoving your resume in people’s faces, you can also take many exciting freebies from the booths. Last year, I received all sorts of stickers, t-shirts, writing utensils, magnets, and even a poker set! Even better, you could score an interview with a top-notch company! I did not but then again, I was a “resume-less” frosh trying to collect as many souvenirs and pamphlets as I could. Despite this, I learned a lot at the career fair. Many of the companies were software-development firms that I was really interested in as a computer scientist. I encourage you to attend the career fair no matter what year you are in. It is true that recruiters may be more interested in juniors and seniors but it is nevertheless a great opportunity to learn about different companies and what type of interns they are looking for. 
On that note , I am going to end my first blog with a hilarious comic from PHD Comics. This reminds me: if you have not seen The PhD Movie yet, you definitely should! It is a great movie produced by our very own Caltech students.
