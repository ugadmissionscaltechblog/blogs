---That means only two more weeks left with my internship in Houston---and then I head out to Guatemala! I'm so excited! But first things first...

My project review last Thursday went so well! I was super nervous the days leading up to it, and was worried that my manager would be unimpressed with the progress and results I had come up with. My greatest fear was that I had overlooked something, or that they would stump me with a question or design concern.

Thankfully, none of that happened! I was given a lot of great feedback on my work, and was able to answer and clarify all the questions they posed. I had been studying the stuff so closely, that I had gotten to the point where I understood every detail of the mechanism and what my analysis concluded of the system. In retrospect, I shouldn't have been so nervous over the review since it wasn't as intense as I imagined in my mind---but it's better that I was prepared for the worst! 
After I presented, my manager then steered me towards a new direction and suggested the next leg of my project. Now I will be working on the actual design of the compensator system (using what I know now about how it will behave in different borehole environments). This means I need to figure out a way to best lay out the inner-workings of the completions tool to allow for maximum efficiency, stay within design parameters and account for any risk/possible failures that might occur. I most likely will use a CAD program (like AutoCAD or ProE) to draft up my design. I'm sure that as soon as I mention it to my papa, he will get excited and bombard me with AutoCAD tips and tricks since it is in within the realm of his expertise--being an architect/engineer himself :) So that's what I'll be doing in my remaining time of my internship; at the end, I will present again to a larger group of engineers. aah! but that's too stressful to think about right now!

I definitely deservedsome fun after my intense week at work. This past weekend, I partied it up in H-town with a few other interns at a popular club in Midtown ---it was so crowded! We waited in line for quite a bit of time before entering the huge venue, which was 3 stories high and had multiple dance floors and DJs. The people I was with said they had never seen the club so packed; the entire time I was on sensory overload--the massive amount of people and energy made it so much fun! On a different night, Stassy and I went with our friend Pablo to a much smaller party/kickback and hung out with students from the University of Houston. I spent the rest of my weekend relaxing, running errands and working on an assignment for the Guatemala research trip with my partner, Sophy. 
Anyway, that's all that's new with me---hope y'all are having a good week!
