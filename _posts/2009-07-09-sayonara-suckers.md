That's what most seniors keep saying to underclassmen in the last week of the spring term, but in all honestly I will miss Caltech. My advice to those of you here and coming here in the fall: always remember to enjoy your college life. You know you are only going to have it once and this was something I did not fully realize and take advantage of until my junior year. Remember to work hard and play hard and you will make the most of your experience here. I don't know if anyone actually read this blog over the course of my sporadic posts. I was much better at this when I was in Scotland. Who knew senior year could be so hard up until the end? I hope that if you have read what I have written, take advantage of the town. Visit the beautiful things like the Huntington Gardens (remember to pre-register for the monthly free student day) and when you are old enough, have a night out on the town in Old Pas, there are some clubs and bars there too. While it might not be Hollywood or the glamorous Los Angeles, it is time away from the academic stress of Caltech. Good Luck to you all and remember to have fun time too. Don't just pull all-nighters for sets!
If you have any questions on anything I have written about or other things to do in Pasadena, don't hesitate to email me, I would love to hear from you. 
All the best, 
Angela
P.S. Don't forget to carry a camera around to capture the memories you make in the next few years. I know I regret not doing it more.
