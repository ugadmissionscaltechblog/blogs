Hey Everyone!
Finals week ended---and since then, I have been enjoying the first part of my Spring Break in New Jersey (spending time with Andrew's family).

It's been a whirlwind few days....I've been to Atlantic City, saw the Broadway Musical MAMMA MIA! in New York, and had an authentic Italian Dinner with an authentic Italian Family. It's so beautiful here in Central New Jersey---in a small quiet town, with lots of countryside.

I'm having so much fun!--but am excited to go back to San Diego for the rest of break.

Here are a few pictures of my trip so far....
