1) With the girls

2) With the houses
Page House held a Galentine's Day event the night before, featuring cookie decorating, waffle making, nail art, and the movie *Chicago*. Fleming House has an annual tradition of everyone working together to write cutenotes for the other members of Fleming. These are delivered to each person's room with either chocolates or roses.
