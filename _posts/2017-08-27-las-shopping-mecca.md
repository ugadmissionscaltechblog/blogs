In high school, I loved going to the mall with friends. Even if I didn't need to buy anything, it was nice to hangout under air conditioning with access to food all around us. Also, it doesn't hurt to window shop and try on dresses that I obviously cannot afford. It is hard to find time to go to the mall during the school year since they are all a drive away. Also, once the bank of mom and dad becomes more stringent, it's harder to go on shopping sprees.


Near Caltech, there is the Westfield Santa Anita Mall which has a huge selection of stores. However, if you really want to be impressed by the selection, head over to Glendale Galleria and Americana right beside it. Glendale Galleria has more affordable everyday stores like Gap, Macy's etc. while Americana has high end options like Tiffany's and Co. You can really tell this shopping location is popular with millennials because there is a cupcake ATM.




When we went, Wholly Guacamole was having a promotional event with a free guac bar. I got some chips and guac with mangoes and tomatoes because I am an avocado addict. People who had Twitter also got a free shirt if they tweeted the event. In fact, they were printing the shirts on site.

One thing I learned from being a serial shopper is to shop online unless shipping is too expensive. I found an Anthropologie store at Americana that was having a sale and it made my day. My friend sat around while I tried on tons of dresses and tops. I ended up with only a pair of joggers since everything there is quite pricey. We had to return to Caltech since we had commitments for later this evening, but I will be back soon.
