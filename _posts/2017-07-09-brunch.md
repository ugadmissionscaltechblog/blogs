Things I love:

- avocados
- brunch
- the beach
- avocados for brunch by the beach


My friends and I went to Santa Monica for brunch today at this super hipster Australian cafe called Bondi Harvest. I found this spot while scrolling through my Instagram feed. Someone shared a photo of a slice of halloumi and avocado toast and it was love at first sight, so I HAD to go!





Luckily, one of us has a car, so we were able to save big time on Uber. Since it was also kind of cloudy, traffic towards the beach wasn't bad. We left before noon, and got there at the perfect time. The cafe was so cute!!

Here are the dishes we ordered. I was in the mood for a bowl rather than toast, so I guess I'll have to come back.

Afterwards we went to the Pier for a quick stroll. It was my first time there, even though I've been living here for a whole school year. The pier was packed with tourists, performing artists, street food vendors and locals wearing sassy t-shirts. There was also an amusement park, which we didn't bother checking out, since we wanted to keep our food in our stomachs.

Afterwards, we decided to detour to the beach and wet our feet in the (freezing) water. It baffles me how toddlers are swimming at such temperatures, but I guess they are a superior species of human. We turned back pretty early to avoid the afternoon traffic even though we had to miss the pretty sight as the sun came out from behind the clouds.


I give brunch 5 stars, the Pier 4 stars, and the weather 2 stars (all out of 5). Keep an eye out for more of my weekend excursions. I promise the mention of brunch will be plentiful!
