I have managed to get ahead of my work, so that tomorrow I get to go flying.

Flying? Huh? Well, I am working on my private pilot's license, and flying is part of the process.

I have always had an interest in airplanes, and the few times I had been in a private plane were fantastic. Last spring, I heard about private pilot ground school being offered at Caltech, so I jumped on the opportunity. It was cheap, on campus, and planes are cool, right? I really enjoyed the ground school, so I decided that while I was SURFing at home this past summer, I would begin my training. I learned to fly a Cessna 152, and I flew a TON, sometimes 5 or 6 days a week.

Here's a picture of me in the airplane:

I even flew so much that I got to solo right before I came back to Tech:

When I got back to Tech in the fall, I flew a couple times at El Monte airport with a new instructor, but when midterms started, I got behind with work and couldn't fly as much as I wanted to. So tomorrow, I will fly for the first time since October, and I am thrilled.

El Monte Airport, here I come!
