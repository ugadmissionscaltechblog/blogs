Every midterm week and final week, Page House Peer Advocates (PAs) put on a de-stressing event. This term for midterms, the PAs hosted a painting night in conjunction with a Page dessert night. (Every Thursday, the House gives $60 to a pageboy (a member of Page) to buy a bunch of dessert and snacks for the house for dessert night.). They provided canvases, paint brushes, and a variety of paint colors for the night. It was a really fun and relaxing time to stop working on sets or studying for midterms for a bit and hangout with friends.

These de-stressing events tend to be self care focused. Past events have been halloween themed trivia with self care baskets as prizes, yoga sessions, face masks sessions, and coloring Page themed images. These events also always have PAs in attendance for emotional support as well!
