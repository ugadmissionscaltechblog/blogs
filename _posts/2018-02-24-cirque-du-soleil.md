This term, ASCIT organized a trip to Cirque du Soleil at Dodger Stadium. Tickets were $10 each, and transportation was provided. It was my first time seeing Cirque du Soleil!
The show was based on Mexican culture, with the name 'Luzia' fusing two Spanish words 'luz' and 'lluvia', meaning light and rain respectively.

I particularly liked the aerial and ring acts, especially with the elements of water present. During one performance, a waterfall was pouring onto the middle of the stage, and in another, there was a simple pool of water at the center. Other acts included contortion, pole dancing, and gymnastics. Also, the decorations were absolutely beautiful, especially the red curtain that fell during intermission in the last photo below.
