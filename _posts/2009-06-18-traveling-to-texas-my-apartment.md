Howdy Y'all!
I just got into Houston, Texas after a hectic day of traveling from Pasadena.

My super shuttle got caught in traffic due to the Lakers Parade in LA, and picked me up an hour late!Not to mention traffic all the way to the airport, and the longest line you have ever seen to check-in. Never did I think I would ever be excited to hear that my flight was delayed---until today; I would have missed the flight otherwise! 

After arriving at the Houston airport, I was greeted by my driver, Demitrius, who was holding one of those signs that said: Schlumberger. We grabbed my bags and headed out to the SUV---the second I went through those doors, I felt the humidity right away. It was in the mid 90s when I arrived 6pm central time, not at all what I'm used to in SoCal.

I was then taken to my apartment at an Extended Stay Suite Hotel. This is where I'll be staying for the entirety of my internship. I am so lucky to have my own place, completely furnished---and paid for, courtesy of Schlumberger! I was ecstatic at how cozy and spacious I found it to be; it has everything I could possibly need. I even have a view of the small pool outside my window :)

But now, I'm wide awake since I have switched time zones--it's 2am here, but it feels like midnight to me. I'm going to have to make the adjustment quick though, since I have work...starting TOMORROW! yikes!
