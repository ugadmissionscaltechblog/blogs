Last weekend, I went to Ghiradelli Square for the Etsy Pop-Up Shop. Etsy is a great online platform for artists to sell unique handcrafted items, so I was really excited to go to a pop-up featuring 60+ artists and their work.

Inside, there were many stands selling a variety of crafts, such as wooden artwork, cutting boards, journals, corgi pillows, jewelry, and more.

I really enjoy browsing through small knick knacks like these and ended up buying a tea strainer for myself It was unique in that instead of just a plain chain hanging off the strainer, there was a wooden animal attached to the chain that you can hang over the side of the mug. That way, you know the chain won't fall into the drink, and there's a cute animal dangling off your cup! The one I got had a cat, but there were also dogs, giraffes, dinos, foxes, and other options.

Afterwards, we went to the famous Ghiradelli chocolate shop in the square. Read the next post for more details!
