Hey there!
Welcome to my new blog, a continuation of my old blog: [Adventures in Internships](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/adventures-in-internships/).

For those of you who've kept up with my previous blog, you know by now that I am currently enrolled in a course here at Caltech this term called E/ME 105: Product Design for the Developing World. You may also have read about my adventure in Guatemala this past summer as I traveled the country and visited rural Mayan communities in search of insight and firsthand knowledge to designing a tool to improve lives and small businesses in such countries. 
If you haven't read my last blog---go check it out and get caught up on all the fun so that you can further understand what this blog is about.:)
