Hey guys!
I've been busy on two important things that seniors have to deal with during this time of year: my THESIS and DITCH DAY. 
The other night...I headed to the art chateau to get started on silk-screening the t-shirts for our Ditch Day Stack. There were other groups of seniors also there working as well. Can't tell you too much about the whole thing....but I can show some pictures...

The Art Chateau's T-shirt screening room is used by all Techers to make t-shirts for their clubs and events...its always fun to see the witty designs people have made in the past--they hang up all around the room for all to see!
