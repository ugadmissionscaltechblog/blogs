This time we headed to Camden Market, where there are a ton of shops and food stalls. It's a basically a huge maze -- we definitely got a little bit lost in there.

There's even an arcade in this place?

Next we headed to Chinatown for lunch, and on the way we walked through SoHo.

We then headed to the Portobello Street Market, passing by the Baker Street station on the way.

There were a lot of cute shops and colorful houses here :) I love how easy it is to get to London from Cambridge! It's just a one hour train ride away, and a return journey with a 16-25 railcard is only 11 pounds.
