Back from my very relaxing break....

...and have been running around since then. I literally got off the train from San Diego this Monday and gave the morning tour. There are SO many visitors on our campus this week ....we need about 5-6 tour guides just to accommodate the morning tour!
In addition to that, I have been bouncing around from meeting to meeting to dance rehearsal to dance rehearsal. With the dance show coming up next weekend and other work I have on different committees...I know term just started---but I have been busier than ever!
I am also studying for my Engineer-in-Training Exam every chance I get...the exam is coming up later in April (more on that later) drafting up my thesis, and starting to get into the swing of my two only courses: Cognitive Psychology &amp; Science Technical Writing.

ANYWAY...I have to go, as I am blogging from the gym, where I have just taken yoga and waiting for my ballet rehearsal to start....will update you guys soon!
