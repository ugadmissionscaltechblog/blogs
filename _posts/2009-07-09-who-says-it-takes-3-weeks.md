title: Who says it takes 3 weeks?

I'm coming up on 3 weeks now since I've relocated to Texas for my internship. I recently remembered reading somewhere that it takes roughly 3 weeks to adjust to a new environment, routine or habit. I guess I'm an exception to that rule since I have not completely adjusted to my new job and life in Houston. (well I guess I've only really been here 2 weeks, since I was generously given a week off-paid vacation)
In light of this, I have listed 5 things that I am still trying to get used to (in no particular order)

- **Weather**- I have lived in Southern California my entire life, and am used to beautiful weather. Here in Texas, it is super hot and humid outside, but freezing indoors since the AC is cranked all the way up. All I can say is: I have a new found appreciation for my home in California.

- **Time Zone**- I know, I know... It's absolutely ridiculous that I haven't adjusted yet (but I assume it's because of staying up all night with my cousins while I visited the eastern time zone last week). I end up passing out right after work between 7-9pm, and then staying awake until 1 or 2, before getting up for work a few hours later. I'm sure I will adjust soon though.

- **The 9 to 5 work week schedule**- First of all, I am actually at work from 730 to 5, and that's not even counting the commute I have to make both ways (thankfully I don't have to drive myself, let alone be awake). It is a struggle having to be alert for that extended amount of time; whereas at Tech, I am used to working around my own schedule. But I definitely help myself through the day by drinking coffee and taking my lunch hour to work out at the gym so I can wake myself up.

- **Dressing in office attire everyday**- It's not that I'm struggling with things to wear since I have built up a pretty good business casual/work wardrobe since my internship with Boeing last summer. It is more of a struggle not being able to just throw on jeans and a t-shirt and head out the door. It does take a little more time planning and readying outfits (ironing, polishing shoes, etc)--but it definitely helps to do all that stuff the night before. I also make sure to take advantage of casual Friday, the one time during the week I allow myself to wear jeans and a slightly more relaxed look.

- **The grocery stores/food chains here in Texas**- I guess it's all the same no matter where you are, but it took me a while to figure out what and where a "Kroger" is (it's like Ralphs). There are a lot of food chains/restaurants I have never heard of before, and I feel somewhat clueless as to where I should go. But it's definitely fun being around new eateries I can try out (just wish my partner in crime/co-food reviewer Andrew was here to help!).
