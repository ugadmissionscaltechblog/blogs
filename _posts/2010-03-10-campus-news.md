Hi Everyone!
March 9 was a big day for our campus; we had two very important and exciting events that occurred: The 25th annual ME 72 Design Competition and the Ribbon Cutting Ceremony of the new Schlinger Laboratory.

This year's ME 72 Design Competition was entitled: "Revenge of the Hindenburg." Back in October, students enrolled in the ME 72 class were given a "bag of junk" and the task: to design and build airships and robots to maneuver a specific obstacle course (shooting and gathering ping pong balls, and moving through a hoop 15 ft above the ground). They were given 20 weeks for the task to build robots to compete in a "Robot Wars"-like event. People from the Caltech community came to the Brown Gym to cheer on the different teams. Team Up, consisting of senior Robbie Paolini and juniors Long Nguyen and
 Paul Suffoletta took home the win :) Congrats guys!

The new building is finally complete and is getting ready for labs to move in--Hooray!
Here are a few pictures I took of the new Schlinger Lab:
