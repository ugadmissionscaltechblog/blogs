Hey Everyone!
This is going to be a short post..but I wanted to share my excitement with you all!---our Guatemalan partners are here in Pasadena!
We met for lunch at Chandler, and then went to class today...which was a bit weird..cause I'm so used to seeing them on the video conference screen as opposed to sitting right next to me!
Next, we gotta start working on our final project and presentation!
