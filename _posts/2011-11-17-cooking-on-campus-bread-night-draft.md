I have already posted about cooking off-campus and mentioned that I feel it is superior to cooking on campus. However, this does mean that cooking on campus is impossible. Occasionally something really awesome happens in an on-campus kitchen. If we're lucky, it happens regularly. We are very, very lucky this year.

There is a frosh who apparently has extensive experience with baking bread and other flour-based tasties. After he started baking bread and sharing it with the other people in the house, demand grew to the point that he is now volunteering his time to bake massive batches of bread for the house once a week. And when I say massive, I mean he used around 25 lbs of flour for this week's bread night. He also generously teaches anyone who wants to learn, which seems to be a good system, since it means there are more capable pairs of hands who can help.

This year, our fancy frosh decided to experiment with an extra-special treat: cinnamon rolls. I was around to receive a tutorial in making these delicacies, a process that started in the middle of the afternoon with a bowl of wet, battery-looking stuff, which is in the messy-looking metal bowl on the left.

Work on the cinnamon rolls re-commenced after dinner, when we rolled out the dough so we could spread the cinnamon filling on it. (The filling, by the way, consists of sugar, butter, and cinnamon.) Then we rolled up the dough and cut the roll into smaller pieces, each of which would become a cinnamon roll.
