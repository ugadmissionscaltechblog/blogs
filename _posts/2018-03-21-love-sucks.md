Every term, the a cappella groups at Caltech have a concert. Their second term concert usually comes around Valentine's Day, and is called 'Love Sucks'. This year, the concert was in Beckman Auditorium, also known as the Wedding Cake. This hall is usually reserved for special events such as Commencement, but since all the other auditoriums on campus were booked this year, they managed to get this very fancy event hall.

Caltech currently has three a cappella groups: Out of Context, Pipettes, and Fluid Dynamics. Out of Context (OoC) is Caltech's oldest a cappella group, and the Pipettes is Caltech's youngest and only all-female group.

We also invited several groups from nearby universities to come perform, including<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=253151471390166&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1" href="https://www.facebook.com/vprcsun/?fref=mentions">CSUN's Vocal Percussion Radio</a>,<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=159594680795805&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1" href="https://www.facebook.com/circleoffifthsuci/?fref=mentions">Circle of Fifths Official</a>, and<a class="profileLink" data-hovercard="/ajax/hovercard/page.php?id=135792293151023&amp;extragetparams=%7B%22fref%22%3A%22mentions%22%7D" data-hovercard-prefer-more-content-show="1" href="https://www.facebook.com/OverflowACappella/?fref=mentions">Overflow A Cappella</a>.

I didn't manage to take great photos during the concert since I didn't want to pull out my phone, but you can watch OoC's set<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNawH3TOcXZXozw9Rzm1KdVPXjgYbHca">here</a>(or the link is: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPNawH3TOcXZXozw9Rzm1KdVPXjgYbHca).
