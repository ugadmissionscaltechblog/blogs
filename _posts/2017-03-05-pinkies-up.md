On Saturday, my friends and I went to The Langham for afternoon tea. The Langham is a fancy hotel in Pasadena, and some people's parents stay there when they visit their kids at Caltech. The afternoon tea is a bit pricey (it starts at $46), but there is plenty of food and it's well worth it. The hotel itself is gorgeous as well. It's a great place to take pictures.

We had five people, and were allowed to choose up to three types of tea. We opted to share the Silk Road Blend, the Darjeeling First Flush, and the English Breakfast. I prefer sweeter teas, so my favorite was the Silk Road Blend, a white tea with jasmine and rose flavors. The Darjeeling First Flush was a close second - it was a black tea with hints of apples and pears.

Next came the tiers of scones, dainty tea sandwiches, and a large selection of desserts. There were cranberry and blueberry scones with clotted cream and an assortment of jams. The sandwiches included chicken salad, pesto shrimp, smoked salmon, ham &amp; egg, and pickled saffron radish. Finally, the desserts included earl grey tiramisu, passion fruit apricot cone, crème brûléetart, raspberry macron, chocolate praline mousse cup, guava cream cheese gateau, coffee tart, and cream puff.
