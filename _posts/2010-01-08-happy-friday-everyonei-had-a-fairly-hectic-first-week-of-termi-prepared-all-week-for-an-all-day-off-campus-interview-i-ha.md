Happy Friday everyone!
I had a fairly hectic first week of term...I prepared all week for an all day off campus interview I had on Thursday. I met with about 6 different managers of a department and gave a 45 minute technical presentation to the group on some work I had done during one of my internships. The day started at 8am and ended around 5pm....I definitely crashed as soon as I got back to Tech!
Earlier this week, I also went up to JPL to work on my thesis (which I will be doing for two mornings of the week). I worked in the balloon lab since it had a huge table where I could lay out all my materials for some pattern cutting. 
I spent about 2 hours cutting up stainless steel sheets and high temperature fabric to wrap the insulation for more testing in the oven. It wasn't too hard, though I got a few nicks on my hands from the steel, and was feeling a bit sore in my hands after all that cutting. But all of us Techers know that that's the price we all pay for getting our research :)

So, that's all for now....I gotta get working on sending my thank you emails to all of my interviewers from yesterday...hope you guys have a great weekend!
