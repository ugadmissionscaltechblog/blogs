Some of the sewing machines on the dining room table.

  One thing we're really good at at Caltech is teaching others, whether it be through research, collaborative problem sets, or TAing classes. Each person has a slightly different background and has mastered unique things. So, my House decided to put on a series of workshops where we could share cool things that each of us knows how to do with each other. Today, I learned how to use a sewing machine from my friend Carly!
  I've hand sewn things by hand a bunch and have used a sewing machine once or twice, but I had no idea how to set everything up from head to toe. In her little workshop, Carly taught me how to do basically anything relating to sewing with a machine. We worked on setting it up with the colors of thread I wanted, winding up bobbins with thread, and performing different stitches. She had some extra fabric to play around with, so I was able to make some of my own little creations. At home, I have a pet dog who is just about my favorite dude in the world. I decided that I would make him a little dog toy.I stitched some pretty designs into some fabric, and then sewed three sides of it up. I filled it with some rice and then sewed the fourth up! Hopefully the fabric will be durable enough for his teeth!
  I also practiced making a little pocket out of all of the scraps, which I can use to hold some little items (maybe some of my minerals from JTI). Overall, it was a super educational experience to learn how to sew. I can't wait to attend other workshops put on by my friends.
