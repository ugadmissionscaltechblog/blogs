Last week ended on a great note. On Friday we had our first lecture with David Politzer (he won the Nobel in physics!) and it was amazing. The lecture consisted of a series of demonstrations on electric fields. My favorite was the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3b23umXzPVA">Kelvin Dropper</a>. It was very cool to be able to see things like these in action and understand what was going on. I can say that I'm very glad to have picked the practical track for physics because I've learned why the window on a microwave has a black mesh with see-through circles on it -- and other very interesting things like that.

That same night a few of my friends and I took the Zipcar out for a ride. Since we had already covered the groceries, this time we went out to explore Hollywood. I brought my companion, the iPod, and added some sweet background music to our scenic route (the freeway was closed so we drove along the mountains). Once there, we found a parking garage and ventured into the streets with stars on the sidewalk. This one was my favorite of the night:
After walking some more we found a club called Avalon and decided to go in. The setup was the typical club setup, a big dance floor in the middle, the stage at the front, VIP lounge on a platform at the back, and bars at the sides -- oh, and also the usual restroom attendant handing out towels and offering Kit Kats and lollipops. The DJ was mixing great house music, and the scene was pretty good. We had a great time dancing; when the club closed we headed back to Tech, making a stop at Carl's, Jr. for some delicious guac burgers. All in all the weekend was great, we were able to go out and explore our surroundings and cool our engines from the past week's work. Now this week has started and we're back to working hard. Today we learned some cool properties about the inverses of matrices and in a few minutes I'll be heading out to my physics recitation to get some help on my electric flux set. Hope you all enjoyed and good luck with the new semester.
