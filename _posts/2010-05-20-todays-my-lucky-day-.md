Hey guys!
I've been so preoccupied with all this stuff going on...that I was completely taken aback when I returned from spray painting for DD to find an email informing me that I had won a free 32G iPad!!
I participated in the Senior Survey where I answered questions about my academic, social and personal experiences my time here at Caltech. It's a bit long, but all the information is super important for the university to be able to evaluate educational programs and analyze data for the benefit of students. Those who participated where automatically entered in the raffle to win the grand prize of an Apple iPad!...I NEVER win anything when it comes to raffles so I was totally surprised to find out it was my lucky day :)
After considering that it could possibly be a joke being played on me and calling my dad to inform him of the awesome prize, I went to go claim my winnings at Caltech Wired (our on-campus computer store) in the afternoon..was sooo EXCITED!
To be honest, I have not even played with one at the Apple Store...I checked out the ones on display, and it was my first time holding one.

I know, I know..I feel retarded for saying that...but seriously....Ditch Day is TOMORROW and I've been focusing on finishing all of the last minute touches on our stack :)..yep...more exciting than the iPad!
Can't wait to play with it though!
