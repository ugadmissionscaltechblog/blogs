Hi all, this is the last post about my spring break adventures in Europe! Our last stop was Prague, Czech Republic. We took the train from Vienna to Prague and checked in to our Airbnb. We decided to take a nice walk through the city to Old Town Square and see the Astronomical Clock Tower. It is the third oldest astronomical clock, and the only one still in operation! We climbed to the top to get a gorgeous view of the cityscape. See pics below!
The next day, we took yet another free walking tour (there are so many in Europe). We saw Kafka's birthplace, the Rudolfinum, Prague Castle, the Jewish Quarter, the Pinkas Synagogue, the Jewish Cemetery, and Old New Synagogue, and a statue of Kafka. Sadly we had to leave the walking tour early to catch our train back to Budapest (in order to make our flight). We booked round trip flight tickets to/from Budapest because it was cheaper than buying two one way tickets to/from different cities.

Prague was a fairytale town - it was so beautiful, but it also felt the most touristy with the street performers and people trying to sell you things. I also felt the need to be much more aware of pickpockets in Prague! Although we didn't get to spend as much time in Prague as the other two cities (Budapest and Vienna), it was a wonderful experience overall and we were glad we made a stop in the Czech Republic!
