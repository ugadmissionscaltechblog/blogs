A few of us bloggers (and some other ladies) visited the Langham Hotel in South Pasadena for afternoon tea this Saturday. Oh my goodness it was delicious. And very fancy. If you've been reading this blog long enough, you'll notice that I wrote an almost identical post last year (2015 Fall) when I was studying abroad at the University of Edinburgh- my mother and I visited the Balmoral Hotel for tea when she flew out to Scotland to drop me off for the start of classes. This experience in Pasadena was nearly identical- there were fewer kilted men this weekend- and I enjoyed it just as much!

Everything was amazing, and I would say this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience, and I can't believe I've been lucky enough to do it twice! If you ever feel like treating a family member, this is a lovely place to go.
