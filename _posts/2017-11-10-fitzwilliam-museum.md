Just a 10 minute walk from my college, the Fitzwilliam Museum is home to artifacts from the Egyptian era to modern times. On the ground floor, there's one room displaying various armory and several huge rooms completely dedicated to ceramics and potteries. Entrance is free, and it's definitely worth visiting.

The collection is absolutely amazing! There are items from all over the world and from all kinds of time periods. There were so many beautiful plates and cups, some with colors that I had never seen on ceramic. It was so beautiful and such an extensive collection -- I would highly recommend going!

Upstairs, there are exhibits from Egypt, Greece, Rome, the Middle-East, and more. In addition, there is a European painting collection.

My favorite part of the museum was the Degas exhibition. It's here from October until mid-January, and it displays sketches, paintings, and sculptures from Degas. They're absolutely amazing, especially the sculptures. I'm so glad I got to see his work and all the other amazing exhibits in this museum, just walking distance from my college!
