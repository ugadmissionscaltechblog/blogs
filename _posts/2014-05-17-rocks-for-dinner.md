All freshmen are required to live on campus, and thus, are required to be on the Caltech meal plan. This gives us access to all-you-can-eat open kitchen food Monday to Friday from 7:00am – 11:00am for breakfast, 3:00pm – 5:00pm for mid-day snacktime, and 5:00 – 7:00pm for dinner. On top of all that, we have $450 every term to buy lunch at Chandler or Broad Café on Weekdays, go to CHouse Sunday through Thursday nights, or buy snacks/meals/convenience store items seven days per week from the C-Store.

But sometimes, on those magical nights, Caltech Dining Services (CDS) decides to get FUNKY. This past Thursday, we had a special CDS dinner that really rocked. In fact, no previous dinner could hold a stick (or stone) to this. Thankfully, we had kale, not *shale* for dinner. It was one for the ages that is definitely made (pre)history. And this meal didn’t just rock, it Bedrocked. You guessed it, this CDS dinner was FLINSTONES THEMED!!
As we love to do, a gang of friends and I dressed up for the occasion, covering all of our Flinstones bases with Fred, Wilma, Barney, Betty, Bam-Bam, and even Dino! Check out a few pictures of the gang below.
