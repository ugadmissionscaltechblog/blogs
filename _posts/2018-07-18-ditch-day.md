Go to bed frosh, Ditch Day is tomorrow!
Well, the real Ditch Day finally came around! Before Ditch Day, the senior class hosts a series of 'fakes'. The fake right before the real Ditch Day involves underclassmen chasing seniors around and taping them to trees, pictured below. I think it's pretty weird, but it's a tradition of sorts.

For Ditch Day, I participated in a Mario Party themed stack. We were split into 4 teams: Yoshi, Koopa, Daisy, and Waluigi. By rolling a huge cardboard dice, we'd progress along the board, and by playing mini games, we would earn coins to eventually buy stars! The team with most stars and coins at the end would win.

The day started off by hitting huge boxes, which contained our t-shirts, with a baseball bat. Then, we were split up into two groups. Two groups went to do the escape room first, and the other two groups went to play outdoor games on the South Fields. I thought the escape room was really well done, and it was fun! The mini games on the South Fields were also fun, especially one where we raced around the track on various carts (a skateboard, a cart, a wagon, and a small square thing with wheels??). During the race, the person on the cart gave directions to avoid obstacles on the track while the person pushing the cart was blindfolded.

In the afternoon, we went off-campus to Grand Central Market and the Broad Museum, where we did two scavenger hunts. Afterwards, we went to GlowZone at Huntington Beach, where we played games and bowled. Overall, it was a super fun day, and my most fun Ditch Day so far!
