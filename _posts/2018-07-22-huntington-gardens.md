During the last week of school, I visited the Huntington Gardens. It's less than a 5 minute drive away from Caltech, and the admission is $21 for a student on the weekday, and $24 on the weekend. Inside, they have several art museums and a library. They also have themed gardens -- there's a desert garden, an Australian garden, a Japanese garden, a Chinese garden, a rose garden, and more.

This time, I visited the Library and the Japanese and Chinese gardens. I passed by the rose garden as well, but it was closed for a private event. The last time I had been to the Huntington was when Professor Gilmartin brought us there last winter for an english class called En 128, Gothic Fiction. It was nice to see the gardens all green during late spring!
The Huntington Gardens are really nice and well designed, but a bit on the pricey side. They do have art exhibits and a library though, which sets them apart. If you're looking for another excellent garden to go to, check out Descanso gardens, which is $6 for students!
