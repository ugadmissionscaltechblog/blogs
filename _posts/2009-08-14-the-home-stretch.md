This is it! I am down to the last couple of days of my internship.

This past Wednesday, I had an exit interview with a panel to discuss
this past summer. We talked about the project I worked on, the overall
internship experience and the possibility of future employment after I
graduate. I feel really confident about the interview, and had many positive things to say about my experience and the internship program.

During these past few days, I have been working hard on my final presentation which I will give this Friday afternoon. I've been working non-stop on the presentation, both in and out of the office. I must admit, though, it has been fun for me putting all of my slides together; I realize that I've learned so much and that I've done very useful work for the group. I'm very proud of myself and what I've accomplished at Schlumberger. At this point, I'm more excited and anxious to give the presentation than nervous--which is a good thing!

BUT! It's not over until it's over, right? Wish me luck on my presentation this Friday, y'all! Will let you know how it goes!
