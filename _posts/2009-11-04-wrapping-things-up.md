Hey all,
As I wrote about [last time](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2009/10/being-on-the-team.html), my race last Saturday was the final one for the season. With that, I will be wrapping up my blog with this post. I think I'm supposed to do some kind of reminiscence or whatnot, but I'd like to keep that short, because I did manage to get those pictures taken! (Well actually, a super-cool ChemE friend of mine took them because he's that awesome.)
Looking back on this season, I'm mildly amused. Due to conflicts and other circumstances, I only ran three of the six scheduled races this year. {Last year, I ran every one.} However, this 50% participation rate is not too bad. I joined the team for the experience of being with a group of smart people who like running, not to do races. Sure, racing is good - and I'm pretty competitive when I want to be!- but I'd rather enjoy [being with my teammates](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2009/10/being-on-the-team.html) than be caught up in the race. 
When I started off, I had pretty normal hopes for how things would go. However, my workload soon caught up with me, and I struggled some to find a balance. Thankfully, things got better when I started running on my own 3 days a week. So this season was a learning experience, I suppose. I like having those, even though they aren't pleasant when they occur. Therefore, I'm pretty content with the way things went.

Coming soon, as promised, pictures!:
EDIT: Here are the pictures. Sorry for the delay.

On the Caltech track. I do not recall how long it has been since we've hosted a meet there, though. However, I like to run there sometimes early in the morning and watch the sun rise over the trees.

In closing, I just wanted to say thanks for reading. I hope I have conveyed a little of what it's like to be a Caltech athlete. I will admit that finding a balance can be difficult, and it's something I had to work through this year. Nevertheless, I am still glad I participate in athletics here at Tech.

Ciao.
