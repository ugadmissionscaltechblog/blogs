There was a lot of crossing ofmosquitoes. Okay, here's a little recap. We screen for transformants on the fluorescent microscope and out of the few hundred larvae per container, we obtain anywhere from 0-20 transformants. We then let these larvae grow into adults and then cross them with wild type ones. Here's a box full of crosses that I had just set.
