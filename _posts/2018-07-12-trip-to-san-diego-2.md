During 3rd term, Page hosts a beach trip to Carlsbad, which is about 2 hours south of Caltech and 30 minutes north of San Diego. Everyone stays in a huge beach house, and we go to the beach during the day. Over the same weekend, my boyfriend and I visited San Diego since I'd never been!
San Diego has amazing tacos (and amazing Mexican food in general). I ate *so* many fish tacos over that weekend, and they were all delicious. I keep thinking about them now that I've come back to Pasadena :P

We also visited Balboa Park, which has many museums, a garden, and an artist's market. It's a really nice area to walk around, and the artisan market was interesting. The tiles were all painted different colors, so it was quirky and cute.

The beaches in San Diego and Carlsbad were both beautiful as well -- I would highly recommend visiting. Make sure to eat fish and shrimp tacos when you go!
