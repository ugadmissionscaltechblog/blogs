My class was cancelled on Friday, so I jetted (actually, trained) off to the beautiful city of Bath. When I was doing my pre-trip research I was surprised to find that the whole city is classified as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO, but once I got there I was no longer surprised. It totally makes sense that such a beautiful place should be cherished and protected!

Amazing finds in Bath:

-The Roman Baths dating all the way backto 70 AD

-I got to "take the water" from this fancy fountain here:

-Jane Austen Centre &amp; many sites from the movies based on her novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion. Sites such as the Royal Crescent, Pump Room, andAssembly Rooms. This is the Royal Crescent (hotel &amp; private residences):

-Active theater scene. I saw a comedy, The Phoenix of Madrid by Calder√≥n de la Barca. The play was fast paced and witty.In Austen's book her characters are out and about in Bath, frequentlyending the night with the theater! I felt veryproud/nerdy doing the same.

Bath was a perfect day trip and a fun way to take advantage of a weekday without class!
