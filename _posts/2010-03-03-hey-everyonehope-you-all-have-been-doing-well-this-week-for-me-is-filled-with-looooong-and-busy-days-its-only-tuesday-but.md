Hey Everyone!
Hope you all have been doing well. This week for me is filled with looooong and busy days. It's only Tuesday, but I feel like this past weekend was forever ago. I am busy wrapping up my student reads for undergraduate admissions---we will be meeting all day Wednesday and Thursday for the regular decision admissions committee (I can't believe it's almost over!). I have also been busy with meetings all over campus --I had 5 meetings all in one day this past Monday! O_O
Weeks like this make me all too thankful for the weekends. This past weekend, I went on a food review to a newly opened place called "The Slawdogs." It was a place recommended to us by Jon from Caltech Dining Services...and it was AWESOME!
This place was so yummy, which probably was reason for why it was so crowded when we went! We were able to choose from an extensive menu of gourmet hot dogs, and even had the option of building our own. I went with the TNT Dog (aka "the good timer") which was a gi-normous chili hot dog with french fries and fried eggs inside wrapped in a tortilla (looked like a burrito). I only got through half of it before feeling incredibly full....

On Monday, the article was published in the campus newspaper :)
All right, that's all for now..gotta get back to reading applications!
