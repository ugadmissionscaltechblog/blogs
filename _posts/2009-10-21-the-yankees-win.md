As the game progressed and the Yanks dominated, I also had to indulge in a Angels Stadium Hot Dog. In my official Caltech Food Critic opinion, nothing beats the Nathan's Hot Dogs in Yankees Stadium...but then again, those are almost $10 and this was $4.50. So at least it was worth the money!

But on the way back to the car, the Yanks scored another 3 runs for a final score of 10-1! Way to go NY!!!!

Also as a senior I can take advantage of my more free schedule ;).
