Good morning, chefs!I apologize for the delay since my last post, even though I'm a senior I still have had a lot to do leading up to Finals' Week! So I want to take this time to update you on what we were up to in class last week - as you may be able to guess from the title, we were cooking fare from the subcontinent - India, that is. Let's just say I learned about spices I never had actually used before - we definitely don't use too much turmeric in Italian cooking! Now one complication from this day was that Indian food is something that usually takes a while to cook, which meant we didn't get to let our dishes stew for hours and hours on the stove (we didn't want to get out *that* late!). However, I will say that our results got approval from my Indian friend, Mallika - she's from Mumbai, so I think that's a pretty big deal. :)
To expedite matters, we each made a different combination of a meat and vegetable. My group made Rajasthani-style beef (the formal name escapes me) and saag. The beef was delicious, with an amazing amount of spices! The saag was a bit different from vegetables I usually had (there were mustard greens in it, and I'm honestly going to say I'm not a fan), but at least I got my vitamin K! Other groups made Chicken Korma (something that comes to mind easier when I'm thinking of Indian food) and Daal (a more creamy side dish). Oh, and of course we prepared some Naan! We decided to spice things up and put garlic in it. Like I said for Italian week... you can NEVER have too much garlic! :D
Well, below are the pictures from this week - I'm excited for this last week because it's Southern Night! And I hear it's the best one - so we'll see how it is!****
