Over the weekend, I went out for lunch at <a href="https://www.zpizza.com/organic-food-menu/healthy-pizza" target="_blank" title="zpizza">zpizza</a>. I've been to one at home, but never in Pasadena. The service at the Pasadena location was great! The staff was super help and understanding. They offer a variety of unique pizzas (ie. Thai or Napoli), as well as the typical variety of cheese, pepperoni, etc. They also provide gluten-free crust on request, and apparently it actually tastes good.

Also, there's a 10% discount for Caltech students :O
I ordered a Napoli and parmesan breadsticks, which were delicious! My friend ordered an Italian. I forgot to take pictures until we were practically done. Whoops :P The Napoli slice is in the center, and the Italian is more towards the right.

My friends and I have noticed that whenever something is called "Californian," such as the Californian sushi roll, it includes avocado. What's funny is that zpizza's Californian does *not*include avocado! This is the first "Californian" food item that I've seen without avocado.

I also went to a Vietnamese resturant off of Colorado, called Indochine. They serve solid Pho, and their shrimp tempura rolls are also really good. I didn't take pictures of my food, but I did take a picture of their crazily-shaped ice cubes.

There's a hole in the center of the ice cube! It's like a little bucket. I was able to hold the ice cube up using a straw.

My next adventure will be to <a href="https://muginohointl.com/" target="_blank" title="Beard Papa's">Beard Papa's</a>, which sells cream puffs. The Pasadena store offers vanilla and chocolate fillings regularly. Over this summer, they will be offering special fillings, such as mango, caramel, or green tea. :O
