This past weekend, Page House rented a place in Carlsbad, CA (near San Diego) for two nights. The house was amazing! It had three stories, several TVs, a private movie theater, and it was right across from the beach.

  Beach tripwas so much fun, and I got to know people in my house better. The best part was waking up in the morning and being able to walk to the beach right after breakfast; the UCCs (upper classmen counselors) and social team made pancakes and fried bacon for everyone. The beach was gorgeous, and it wasn't crowded or dirty (unlike some of the popular LA beaches). People went boogie boarding, built sand castles, and had a great time together.

  After the beach, a few of my friends and I walked to In-N-Out before heading back to the house. I had to leave beach trip early to be back home for Mother's Day, but overall, I had a great experience and I can't wait for next year's beach trip!
