I'm currently taking ceramics, an elective at Caltech. It's held from 7-10pm on Wednesday nights at Polytechnic, a private school across the street from Caltech. Ceramics is very laid back - it's all about you making whatever you want. You can leave early or show up late if you have a lot of work on a particular night. The instructor gives demonstrations as well. You can also repeat the class or just show up, so essentially this classjust gives you access to a pottery studio and materials for three hours a week. In this post, I will take you on a "tour" of the ceramics studio.

You can see the many different glaze colors available!

People who are using the pottery wheel take their blocks of clay directly to the wheel.

Whenever you need clay for your piece, you can come here and cut some. There are stamps in the bowl for making patterns on your clay.
