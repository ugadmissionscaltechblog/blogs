Hi friends,
I was pretty busy for the first week of term because I was still unpacking from my spring break trip and rehearsing for the dance show that weekend. My friend Suchita has been teaching us choreography that she put together since the beginning of second term way back in January. We danced to three songs, Beyonc√©'s "I Slay," Rihanna's "Yeah I Said It," and Iggy Azalea's "Team."

The days leading up to the show weekend were pretty crazy. We rehearsed an hour or two nearly every day for a week. Thankfully, it was the first week back from break, so classes hadn't gotten too busy yet. I'm glad I was able to participate in my last dance show!
keep lookin' up,
jenny.
