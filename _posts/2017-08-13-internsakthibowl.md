This summer, I’m an intern at Microsoft, and I’m fortunate to be a part of a company that waits on their interns hand and foot and is absolutely dedicated to showing us a good time. Microsoft is composed of five different business groups. As one of the interns that work on supporting Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure and operations, I’m part of the Cloud and Enterprise business group headed by Scott Guthrie. And of course, this past weekend all of the interns had an event for their business group.

This past Thursday, Microsoft rented out Lucky Strike, a luxurious bowling alley in Downtown Bellevue with arcade games and plenty of snacks for 300 interns for the entire day. They also threw in a Cloud and Enterprise sweatshirt and socks. It was an awesome event with music pumping through the venue all day with plenty of full-time employees there as well to talk to us about their positions at Microsoft. After snagging some high quality salted caramel crunch cookies, I headed off to the bowling alley with the other interns on my team. I really failed to prove myself, hitting the gutter about six times in a row. I followed that up with a strike, but there was really no way to come back from that.

With two embarrassing bowling games under my belt, I headed out to the arcade only to find more lack of success at the basketball hoop and the skeeball machines. But despite my displays of athletic prowess, I had a great time, meeting a lot of the amazing interns and hearing stories from the full-time employees.
