Today I did the most millennial thing possible. We drove for an hour then waited in line for an hour just to eat the best toast in LA. <a href="https://sqirlla.com/menu/">Sqirl in LA</a> is known for it's amazing breakfast/brunch dishes. The owner Jessica Koslow is a bit of a celebrity and has been featured in tons of cooking shows, magazines and rave reviews. Sqirl is packed from open to close every day because its jams and toasts are just that good and it does the whole seasonal + sustainable + farm to table thing.




I needed to make sure that this place lives up to the hype ;) This place is seriously hipster chic. 90% of the people here look like models. The irony is that the rest of the neighborhood is extremely impoverished and there are homeless people and potholes all around.


Anyways, on to the food. We actually went a really great time since Jessica was assembling the food herself! I was slightly starstruck for a moment.

Here's what we got: French toast, almond butter and cacao nib butter toast with a latte, sorrel pesto rice bowl, and house made granola with house made yogurt and boysenberry jam. The brioche toasts were AMAZING. There's nothing more heavenly than burnt brioche. Everything else was also extremely satisfying.

All in all, 10/10 would wait again for over-priced hipster Californian food. Now I need to go buy her cookbook :P By the way, check out how this awesome food is made:
