Every term, the geology department offers a class called Ge 136: Regional Field Geology of the Southwestern United States. A 3 unit class, the entire class consists of writing a 1-2 page report, going on a field trip, and presenting on your report during the field trip. The class is open to everyone, not just Geology and Planetary Science (GPS) majors. But it's quite a popular class, so it fills up quickly.

During the trip, we camp every night, and for food, we make sandwiches for lunch and cook breakfast and dinner. The food (especially at dinner), is always amazing. Everyone helps out to cook and clean up, and we hang around the campfire at night and eat s'mores :)
This year, the class visited Meteor Crater, Red Rock Canyon, and Sedona. The landscape during the whole trip was amazing! I'll let the photos below speak for themselves. On the last day, a donkey even came near our camp :O
