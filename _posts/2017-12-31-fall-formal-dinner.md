During Christmas time (or really just after Thanksgiving has ended), the Blacker socteam (social team) gets a Christmas tree for the house to celebrate the holiday spirit. However, what we do is a little unique; we don't have a stand in which we put the tree. Instead, it hangs from our ceiling by ropes and pulleys. We put eye bolts through the trunk of the tree to tie the rope around, and there are similarly things on which to secure the rope on the ceiling of our lounge.

It is put up so quickly such that we can use it for pictures during our termly formal dinner. No one dresses up in finery often, so we always make the most of it by taking as many pictures as possible to commemorate the occasion. It is after all rare to see so many people in the Hovse presentable all at one time.
