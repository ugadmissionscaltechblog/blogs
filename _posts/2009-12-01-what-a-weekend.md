Well, readers, I hope you all gave thanks this past Thursday! We're all here another year to stuff ourselves with turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, CRANBERRY SAUCE, and PUMPKIN PIE (I wonder what my favorite things are in that list...). But most importantly, Thanksgiving is about FAMILY. Unfortunately, I was unable to go home for the holiday (but, you say, I was just there! and in that respect you are correct).But there was no need to worry, since many Techers stay on campus for the weekend. Each House usually puts on a Thanksgiving feast for everyone who's around! Definitely a great way to catch up with your House "family." However, this post will not be about Thanksgiving, since that would be too cliché. It will be about the THREE DAYS AFTERWARDS!
Now what would be blog-worthy about the days after the Day of Thanks? First and foremost...BLACK FRIDAY! Yes, I was among the masses trying to jump-start the economy on that all-important shopping day. I didn't get up at 5 AM to hit the stores, but went out for a leisurely afternoon with my good friend, Lisa. I rented a Zipcar for the afternoon (look it up - they just started a rental program at Caltech and it's only $8 an hour!) and we headed to the nearby Santa Anita Mall. Let's just say...I found some really amazing deals. From $13 TV show seasons on DVD to half-price sweaters at Abercrombie, I definitely got to shop till I dropped!

Even after an exhausting day on Black Friday, the fun didn't stop! I was really fortunate that I was able to meet my parents in SIN CITY - LAS VEGAS, NEVADA! Only a 45 minute flight (or 5 hour drive) from campus! :)
Now if you know anything about me (besides that I'm Italian, from NJ, like food, and am hopefully going to be an MD/PhD), you MUST know that I LOVE LAS VEGAS! Not 21 yet? No worries! I've been frequenting the city for as long as I can remember, and between the stores, pool, cool hotels, and food I definitely have been able to keep busy. I really had a great time this trip seeing my parents and hitting up my favorite Vegas locations. If you need any advice on restaurants, here's my (possibly unsolicited) recommendations.

- Buffet: Cravings Brunch at the Mirage
- American/Everything: Grand Lux Café at the Venetian or Palazzo
- Chinese: Jasmine at the Bellagio (and you can see the fountains!)
- Italian: Sensi at the Bellagio

So now it's picture time!

Time for the FINAL push towards FINALS WEEK!! Dum dum dum! But first, my NYU visit - wish me luck! Too bad I didn't have any in Vegas...maybe next time!
