The Sunday before classes start, ASCIT organizes a carnival with the help of Tom Mannion for Caltech students and affiliates, lasting from 3pm to late at night, around 9pm. This year, there were inflatables such as a bouncy house and human Foosball, a trampoline wall, and carnival games. I had a lot of fun playing the games and winning prizes, from back scratchers to tiny little plushies.

One of the best parts of the carnival happens when it gets dark. Thatâ€™s when the organizers set fireworks off behind the Beckman Auditorium (the building we call the wedding cake for its white color and large circular shape). Before the show, Tom was handing out glowsticks, which some people used as poi, spinning them around in different ways to create really cool patterns.

The show this year was also spectacular, as all of the fireworks set off were synchronized to music. With a showing of Guardians of the Galaxy 2 afterwards, I give <a href="https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/blogger-sakthivetrivel/">Sakthi</a>, the ASCIT president, all the props she deserves for organizing such a fun carnival!
