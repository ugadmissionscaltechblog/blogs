<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Hi everyone!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">I know I usually post about artsy things, but hey, this is Caltech! And what's Caltech if not first and foremost academically rigorous? So we're nearing the end of our last week of classes. Which means next week, is FINALS! My last finals week as a frosh :) One of my classes, Bi1 (the full title is Biology 1: Micro- to Macro-Biology: Integrating Basic Principles Across the Life Sciences) is a little bit unorthodox and is giving a timed, in-class exam. (Normally, most of our finals and midterms are "take-home," meaning we can do them whenever we want, wherever we want, under the protection of the Honor Code.) The professors have given us twenty questions, and from these they will pick six to be on the exam, and we will choose three to answer. Each of our answers should be about a page long.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">I've been up for quite some time now working on my study guide. I definitely should have started it a few days earlier, but I've been pretty busy with other stuff. I *really*want to do well in this class--I think my grade right now is around a B- or B, and I'd love to get a B+ or A-, so it feels like it's within my reach!!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Since Caltech has this legendary stereotype of all-nighters (and it looks like I'm about to pull my first one), I thought I'd give you guys a taste of what it's like!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**3PM-9PM**: Casually working on the study guide, making very slow but steady progress. Taking a lot of breaks to talk to people and eat and stuff.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**10:30PM**: Collaboration time! Got together with a few friends to talk about some questions and concepts.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**11:13PM**: Left the group to venture out on my own. Intense study period commences.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**12:00AM**: RAGE AGAINST BIOLOGY. I'm kind of frustrated because I feel like I'm not making much progress. So I take a break to listen to some music and browse various stupid websites. After being kind of cranky about the amount of work I have left to do, I decide complaining obviously won't help and I get re-motivated :) Back to liking biology!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**2:00AM**: COFFEE TIME. Alas, as nowhere is open at this hour, I am limited to making instant :(

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**3:15AM**: Wow I am pretty tired. About six more problems to do?

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**4:31AM**: Starbucks opens at 5, wondering if I should make a pilgrimage up the street... But I should probably shower, I kind of smell bad at this point.

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**6AM**: Maybe I should go for a run! That would be really nice. But hey! My best friend Caro just stopped by my room to collaborate! Yayyyy more brain power :D

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**8:30AM**: Okay, probably time to get ready for class now, as I have math in 30 minutes. MORE COFFEE.

<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;">**10:30AM**: Just got some really good news about one of my other classes :))) I feel much more motivated to keep pressing on! I started to make my 3x5 index card that we're allowed to bring into the test (this happens a lot at other colleges, but not so much at Tech), and I had no idea I could write this <span style="font-size: 11px;">tiny<span style="font-size: x-small;">!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**12:29PM**: 30 minutes til the test. Ahhhhhhh. This is so weird, I'm not used to in-class exams! Time to grab lunch!

<span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">**2:30PM**: Ahhh It's over! And I think I did really really well!!! :D Now it's time to go get some SLEEP!

<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Hope you guys enjoyed this brief sneak peek into what a finals week at Caltech is like ^_^ Remember, they won't ALL require all-nighters! Questions and comments are always welcome below!

<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Love,

<span style="font-family: 'trebuchet ms', geneva;">Lori
