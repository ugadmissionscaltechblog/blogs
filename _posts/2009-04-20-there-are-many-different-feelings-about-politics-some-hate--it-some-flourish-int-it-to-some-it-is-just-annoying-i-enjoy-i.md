There are many different feelings about politics. Some hate
it, some flourish int it. To some it is just annoying. I enjoy it. It’s really
interesting. I’m taking Introduction to Political Science this term and it’s
great having it play out right outside my room. It’s election season at Caltech
and every position in the Houses and ASCIT (our student government) is up for
contention. 
When I give tours I spend a lot of time talking about the
labs, classes, and pranks, but rarely do I mention student government so here’s
the overview.

ASCIT:

|                 |                               |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| Anthony Chong   | President                     |
| Andrey Poletayev| Vice President of Academic Affairs |
| Pallavi Gunalan | Vice President of Non-Academic Affairs |
| Michael Maseda  | Director of Operations        |
| Maral Mazrooei  | Treasurer                     |
| Nadia Iqbal     | Director for Social Activities |
| Joel Nikolaus   | Secretary                     |


Houses: There are a
million house positions from President to Cannon Master. Here is a general idea

President

Vice President

Secretary

Treasurer

Head Social Team Manager 

Head Athletics Manager 

Vice Social Team Manager 

Vice Athletics Manager 

Soc Frosh (Usually four)

Ath Frosh (Usually four)

Historian

Librarian

Food Representative




These are the people that keep everything running from organizing
athletics matches and parties to handling inter-house disputes.





So during election season, when all the positions are
being filled, the corridors are filled with gossip about who is running and who’s
going to win. The rules are complicated and every now and again some argument
will break out over the constitution (every house and ASCIT has one). It all
adds spice to game and with only 900 students anyone can play. I never did
anything with student government in high school, but I’ve held positions here
at Caltech. It’s fun and adds some diversity to the science!




To relax after all that craziness a bunch of us went to
the beach (pics below)!
