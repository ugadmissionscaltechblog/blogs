Uber Eats sponsored a food festival in the South Lake Union district of Seattle last week. There were tons and tons of food trucks lining both sides of the street, and the whole thing was about 4-5 blocks long. I went with two Pageboys to the food festival, and we happened to run into two other people from Caltech while we were there!

We got this aesthetic lemonade in a mason jar :P

In addition to food vendors, there were people selling posters, postcards, jewelry, ceramics, and other art pieces. I bought a cute card from this store :)
