Hey guys...this is going to be a short post as I am in dire need of a nap right now.

Just got out of Regular Decision Admissions Committee Day 1...basically I've been holed up at the admissions office since breakfast this morning making final decisions on the regular decision applicant pool. You may remember my post on the [Early Action Committee](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2009/12/ea-admissions-committee-my-anniversary.html) we had last term. Since I have been reading so many apps this reading cycle...this committee is really the culmination of it all...this will be the end of the road for putting together the incoming Caltech class of 2014.

Today was difficult and mentally taxing on all of us...since it gets very difficult in making decisions for extending admission/waitlist/deny to all the talented high school students. Especially this year, we got a record number of applicants! INCREDIBLE....but makes my job as a dedicated student reader even harder.

Nonetheless, we were very productive today and we'll probably wrap up a bit early tomorrow during Day 2 if we continue at the rate we're going.
