Being in Southern California, there is really no shortage of boba or boba places. I personally haven’t explored a ton of them, relying on friends’ favorites as my own go-to places. And at those places, like Factory Tea Bar and Half &amp; Half, I really can’t go wrong. But with another one of my friends, who is only a little more clueless about boba than I am, we decided we wanted something different.

The way we settled on trying LaBobatory was quite simple really. She saw the name, neither of us could even fathom how great it was for Caltech students to go there, and the destination was settled. Our expectations were not disappointed.

First of all, the interior decorations are cute, and fit with the name to a T. Sciencey flasks are on all of the counters, some empty, some with tea leaves inside, others with stuffed animals. The boba itself is of very high quality, with a not-too-firm, not-too-soft consistency, and in my drink, I could actually taste the honey in the boba. The drinks themselves are also far more adventurous than other places: while I got an Horchata boba (yummy), my friend got a drink that was Cookie Butter flavored. Amazing right?
