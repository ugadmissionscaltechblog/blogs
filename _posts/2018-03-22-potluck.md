At the end of the term, just before Venerable interhouse, my friend Janice organized a potluck at the Chester apartments, which is Caltech-owned off-campus housing. She invited her separate friend groups to meet in one place, so there were a lot of people I didn't know, but it was fun meeting new people!
The theme of the potluck was 'food that reminds you of home' -- a really cute theme. I made braised pork rice, which is a classic Taiwanese dish. Others made arugula salad, bread with trout spread, gimbap, hot cheetos chicken, channa, curry puffs, and more. We could barely fit all the food on two tables!

I met new friends and had a great time, so I hope there will be another potluck next term, or maybe I'll host a barbeque at the Chesters!
