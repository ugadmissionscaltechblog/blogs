****Hello!So I'm back from break, and now in addition to my light courseload (see below), I am faced with a very important choice - where do I go for my MD/PhD training this upcoming year? I'll be straight with you guys, it's a three-way decision between University of Michigan, University of Washington, and Tufts University. Currently, that's my approximate preference order, but it ALL could change upon revisiting the schools (my revisit to Caltech's Prefrosh Weekend was actually what made me want to come here over other schools, such as MIT and Princeton).

My first visit is actually this week, to UW. Flying up on Thursday morning, having a packed couple of days, and then flying back on Sunday morning. After that it's off to Michigan - flying out there next Wednesday, flying home Friday night, then back to Tech on Sunday afternoon. It was actually cheaper to fly that way - strange, huh? In talking to my support network here, I've come up with some criteria to look at. Talking to Professor Rothenberg (my bio major advisor, also doing research in her lab) helped me figure out the differences between the research opportunities at both schools, and then talking to Aadel (the Fleming House RA, currently a PhD student on a break from med school at Stanford) put some perspective on this decision (since he made one a few years ago). I'm really glad I got a lot of people here at Caltech that I can turn to when I have these burning questions to ask.

As you'll see in the pictures, I'm not sure what I'm going to do, and this indecision is permeating my life (especially since for my whopping 2 classes all I have to do is read)! More on my visits soon!

But I think I'm going to have a gut feeling one way or the other - we'll see!
