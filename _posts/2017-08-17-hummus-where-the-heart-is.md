I think we found the best Mediterranean lunch spot in LA. [Dune](https://www.yelp.com/biz/dune-los-angeles) is a small restaurant in Atwater
Village serving up delicious Mediterranean fare. It was featured multiple times on Eater LA, LA Times, and other food blogs so I decided to give it a try with my foodie friends. We ordered hummus plates with tabbouleh, falafels and fried chicken. Each of the plates comes with salad, pickles, olives and a side of pita.




I am in love with this restaurant because I was watching an interview with the owner, and he said that the restaurant doesn't have a freezer because everything is so fresh and that is the way that Mediterranean food is supposed to be prepared. Everything is made in house, from the pita, to the hummus, to the labneh and yogurt. We all agreed that this place is top quality and that we will return to try more, especially now that they are serving brunch with traditional dishes like shakshuka and Mediterranean inspired avocado toast.


Afterwards, we decided to hit up [the local farmers market](https://seela.org/markets-atwater-village/). There were tons of vendors selling organic produce. This farmers market operates from 10am-2pm every Sunday. From what I can tell, it is quite popular with the locals since everyone is walking around tasting the delicious fruits, veggies, and breads, and buying bags to take home. My friend bought a bag of lavender tea. I was tempted to buy some too, but I had just stocked up on teas the week before. Farmers markets are a great way to get quality goods for a decent price all the while supporting a more sustainable food chain, so I would definitely recommend you check it out!
