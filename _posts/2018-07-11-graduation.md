The graduation of the class of 2018 was on June 15th. A lot of my friends are seniors, so it was a bit bittersweet for me, but I'm very happy for all of them :)

It was super hot that day, so there was even a cooling area for people to sit next to fans and mist.

Before their graduation, my friends also took graduation photos that turned out really cute :)
