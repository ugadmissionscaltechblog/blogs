This past Thursday, I went to the Farmers Market in Queen Anne on the west side of Seattle. I had looked online and seen that some food trucks were going to be there in addition to the regular market, but I didn't expect there to be an entire eating area with about 10 food stalls/trucks! There's a huge seating area and lots of families eating there, so it was a nice surprise :)

I got Caribbean food from this truck called Papa Bois -- it was soo delicious! I got the Orient bowl, which has slow cooked pork on pistachio rice, with some veggies and fried plantains for $10-11. It was amazing. I would definitely come back again for this particular truck!! (Although the food trucks rotate weekly, so you have to check online if they will be there or not.)
