My room looks like a hurricane came through it (I guess Houston is known for hurricanes, right?) as I am struggling to pack it all before I fly back to LA this Tuesday.

It's not as easy as simply stuffing stuff into my luggage---I have to also plan ahead and separate the stuff I am taking to Guatemala. As soon as I arrive in LAX at lunchtime on Tuesday, I have an 8 hour window to get back to Tech and repack my stuff to leave for Guatemala. Because of the amount of time I have, I really need to be organized and plan ahead so that it all runs smoothly. On Saturday, I made sure to get all the last minute stuff I needed, shipped some stuff to my family in CA, and confirmed all of my travel arrangements.

On another note, I had my final presentation at work on Friday--and it went really well! I am so relieved that it's over, though--cause I started to get really stressed over it all. But I'm so happy it went really well and that now I can focus on my next adventure!
Sorry for such a short post!---I gotta get back to packing y'all....
