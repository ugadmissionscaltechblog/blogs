I had the chance this past weekend to visit one of my high school friends in Berkeley, CA. I say I “had the chance” because I took advantage of the “reading period” that Techers have between the last day of classes and the official beginning of finals week to skip town. It was maybe not the best idea, especially considering I hadn’t yet started studying for my finals, but I found cheap plane tickets to the Bay Area and I jumped at the chance.

We hung out in Berkeley on Friday, with a stop at an awesome pizza place in Albany. We went to Napa the next day and I (legally) had the chance to sample a handful of wines from different wineries in the area. This was definitely something I couldn’t have done at Caltech! But the weather is better in LA :P

I learned, after taking a tasting class and tasting a bunch of different wines, that I still don’t really enjoy wine. So we went back to downtown Berkeley and saw Moana to kill some time. It’s one of the only movies currently out that I hadn’t gotten the chance to see while at school this term! There were alley events to see movies, and an ASCIT campus event to see Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them. I’m also working with the Caltech Y (as the president of the Feminist Club) to arrange a screening of Hidden Figures next term for as many students as possible.

The Feminist Club is also arranging one or two speakers next term, as well as a panel discussion and a “History of American Feminism” lecture series. I’m very excited for everything we have planned for the rest of the year. I’ll keep you posted on this blog! ‘Till next time :)
