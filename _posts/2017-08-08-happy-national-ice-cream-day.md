Today was National Ice Cream Day! If you ever wonder where all these weird holidays (National Garlic Day, French Fries Day etc.) come from, check out [this podcast by Planet Money](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/04/18/524577372/episode-765-the-holiday-industrial-complex). I love listening to Planet Money when I'm doing petty work. It makes me feel like I'm gaining IQ points (yes, I know that's not how IQ works).

I thought I would share with you the most delicious tasting ice cream from my new favorite ice cream spot: Afters Ice Cream, which is only a 7 minute walk from campus. Afters is only worth the hype and price tag because the portions are huge and the flavors are gourmet.

I recently tried their Jasmine Tea flavor and I was like:

The only slightly-offsetting aspect of the ice cream was that it's purple. It doesn't take a botanist to figure out that tea does not grow in that color. I'm not a fan of artificial colors or flavoring, so I am hoping that it is actually tea infused, with natural coloring.

On a side note, I am super impressed by the marketing scheme of these independent ice cream shops. Afters' collaboration with Hello Kitty and devotion to creating an Instagrammable venue has allowed it to take over the internet by storm! No one but millennials that scour Yelp and Insta for their next lunch or dessert fix would rave about a $4 scoop of ice cream (even if the scoop is 3/4 of a pint). I guess I am that millennial, so I am sold.
