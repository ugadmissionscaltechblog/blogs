Last weekend, I went to get brunch with my friends. We went to Bird's Nest Cafe near USC, which serves pancakes, tacos, sandwiches, omelettes, and more. I got the Sunrise Tacos pictured below, and I thought they were delicious. They usually come with avocados which would probably make them super appealing for most people, but unfortunately I'm allergic to avocados :( I would recommend coming to this place, since it's really cute, not expensive, and quick!

Afterwards, we went to Cafe Bora in Koreatown, a cafe that specializes in purple yam desserts. Purple yam is a type of korean vegetable, so it's different from ube and regular yam! The cafe itself was incredibly cute. Everything had a purple and white theme, and the layout and decor of the place was just soo cute.

This is my friend Fabio trying the purple yam ice cream! I tried a bit of it, and it definitely has a distinct flavor. I'm not really sure how to describe it though.

I got the purple yam tiramisu :) I thought it was really yummy, although the layer of powder on top was a bit too thick. I stole the flower from Fabio's ice cream, so it actually comes as a small bowl with tiramisu and a flat layer of powder. I personally liked the tiramisu better than the ice cream, so I would get that if I came again. They do have a purple yam bingsu as well, so I might try that next time instead. It is a bit more expensive though -- the bingsu is $8, while the ice cream and tiramisu are $3-4.
