"Music is the silence between the notes."
-Claude Debussy
There is always something that needs to get done. I have accepted that. There's is always a set to do, a book to read, or a paper to write. But sometimes, despite all of this, we need time off. Sometimes, we need the physical distance from campus to reinvigorate ourselves. This weekend, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to go to downtown LA.

We went to the Walt Disney Concert Hall for a concert. There is a Minimalist Jukebox festival going on in Los Angeles right now and we went to one of the performances. We heard David Lang's "Little Match Girl Passion" and also one of Steve Reich's work. Minimilism is a sort of avant-garde classical music. For those of you willing to try it out, you should consider listening to Philip Glass's "Metamorphosis." It is one of the best pieces of music to study to. This will slowly start to grow on you as well, I assure you!

Here is a picture of the inside of the hall. This was taken right before I was scolded by the usher for taking a photo.
