Across the river Cam about a thirty minute walk away is West Cambridge. This area is home to the Computer Science Department, the University Sports Centre, the Institute of Astronomy, and more. Food trucks come on a regular basis, so there's no need to worry about getting food back in town or in college between lectures.

On the way, there are large grassy fields. It was beautiful this afternoon as the sun was lowering.

These fields are home to cute hares, magpies, robins, and more. Last time I came here I cycled, but today I walked along it to look for hares. Although I didn't see any in the morning, I saw a robin with a red throat and chest, and it was so cute!
