Hola,So yeah, basically the title says it all. My normal week. Saving people and then after doing so, eating a bunch. Hah. Well, at least the latter is true! Last week the Red Cross came and I decided to give blood. This was my second time giving blood. The first time was also at Caltech, earlier in the school year. I really don't mind giving blood and it feels good knowing I'm helping someone, but the people at the Red Cross are always calling me telling me to donate. And I always tell them the same thing...that it's too hard to donate unless the bus comes to Tech. But I stay true to my word and if I have room in my day, I make an appointment.
