One of the highlights of having to come back early from the <a href="https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2014/04/geology-rocks.html" style="color: #00bfbf;" target="_blank">Ge 1 field trip</a>was getting to see what Blacker did for Interhovse. I'd never seen How to Train Your Dragon, so after we took a tour of Blacker's interpretation, my roomie, Gauri (you'll meet her furreal later), made me go watch it. (:
Only afterwards did we both realize just how thorough Blacker was. It's clear they had a lot of fun with their theme. Without further ado, some pictures:

Baa.

That huge monster thing of which even the dragons are scared.

Even the snacks were so meticulously crafted!
