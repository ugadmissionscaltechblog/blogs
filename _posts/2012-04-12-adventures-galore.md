HI. My name is Joanne Lynn. I am from Troy High School in Fullerton, CA (GO WARRIORS!). I like food. I like Caltech too. :) PFW so far has been a blast (even though it’s been a bit windy and cold). Talking to everyone from different places makes up for all the glum weather; Caltech people are seriously the coolest, most intelligent, most informed collection of interesting people you’ll ever meet. Looking forward to food in 30 minutes or so, and definitely lots of SOCAL ADVENTURES in store for tomorrow.
