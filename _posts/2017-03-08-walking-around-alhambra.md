It is the setting of a Youtube short by Wong Fu Productions, "How Old Is She?!" that has garnered over 4 million views since it published in 2015.

The food is dumped out in front of you on the table, where you can go at it with your bare hands.

Big Catch Seafood House, a sister restaurant to the nearby EMC Seafood, has $1 oysters during Happy Hour. Its regular menu features upscale dishes such as uni pasta, bone marrow, and a seafood tower with a 3 digit price tag.

Most people go for the All-You-Can-Eat option. Diners grill their own meat and eat it with traditional accompaniments like kimchi, rice wrappers, and assorted side dishes.
