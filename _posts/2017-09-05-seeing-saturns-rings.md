When I came down to LA, I got to use a telescope to look at the moon and Saturn!

The moon was setting as we were setting it up, but we still got to see its surface up close through the telescope. It was amazing! I've never seen such a detailed view of the moon's craters.

Next, we turned the telescope towards Saturn. Now this was really, really amazing because we could see Saturn's rings! I've seen Saturn in the sky before, but it was always just a bright speck of light in the night sky. Through the telescope, I could actually see its rings and some of its moons.

Next time, I'm looking forward to observing Jupiter. But before that, on 21 August, I'm going up to Oregon to see the solar eclipse. I'm so excited!!
