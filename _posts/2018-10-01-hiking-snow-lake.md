The Snow Lake trail is a 6.4 mile with an elevation gain of 1700 ft. It's about a hour drive east from Seattle, near the Snoqualmie Pass. Out of the 5 hikes I've done in the Seattle area, this one has been my favorite! I would highly recommend it.

When you drive up to the trail head, it looks like you're driving into a small alpine village/chalet area, which was kind of odd but interesting! The hike starts with a climb with a lot of switchbacks, but it's beautiful to look out and see how high you've climbed and look out at the mountain range around. There are also edible berries along the trail (although I'm not sure what kind of berries they are, but I ate some and nothing bad happened to me).

Once you get to the top of the first mountain, you can look down and see Snow Lake! The lake is amazingly clear; it's so beautiful! There's also snow surrounding the edges still even though it's summer. We climbed down next to the lake, and I went in for a short swim :) It was super cold, since the water is snowmelt, but it was really refreshing after getting all dusty on the hike.
