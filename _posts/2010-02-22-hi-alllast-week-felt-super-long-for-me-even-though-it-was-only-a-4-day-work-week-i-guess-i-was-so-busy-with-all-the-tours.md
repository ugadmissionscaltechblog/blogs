Hi all!
Last week felt super long for me, even though it was only a 4-day work week. I guess I was so busy with all the tours I have been taking (lots of high school students on break and visiting college campuses!) and various meetings for the different committees/extracurriculars I'm involved with. On top of that, don't forget classes, dance classes and analyzing data for my thesis...I had a pretty dense week. 
On Friday, I was also very lucky to have sat in on a fast-pitch to the <a href="https://www.techcoastangels.com/Public/content.aspx?ID=EA6BF3BF-964F-11D4-AD7900A0C95C1653">Tech Coast Angels</a> at one of their regional meetings (happened to be here on campus last Friday). The Tech Coast Angels are "A network of individual investors who fund early-stage, technology companies in Southern California." It was very interesting to see a CEO of a small start-up make a presentation on a very cool technology (sorry can't disclose anymore since we all signed confidentiality agreements!); it's basically like that show on ABC, Shark Tank. As a business major, I really enjoyed the experience with the Tech Coast Angels. I got the opportunity to see firsthand how an entrepreneur must handle expressing enthusiasm for his product, and present a flawless business model to investors. It will definitely help me in the long run, and also in the current class I am in, another Pickar class: E102: Entrepreneurial Development (<a href="https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/class-in-session-eme-105/">Remember my previous blog on E/ME 105 taught by the same professor?</a>) where I am working with a team to prepare a business model/plan and pitch to Tech Coast Angels for a technology that was developed here at Caltech. Business has always interested me, and I am super happy I was able to double-major in that and Mechanical Engineering here. But more on that later...

After having a hectic week and previous weekend, I reveled in a very relaxed weekend. I caught a movie and hung out over by the Staples Center in Downtown LA, cooked dinner with a friend, and made a quick trip to Paseo Colorado. 
A lot of Techers go to Paseo since it is only a 20 minute walk away from campus and has a movie theater, many restaurants and shopping. It's a pretty nice outdoor mall that has something for everyone. The past few times I've visited Paseo, I have gone to see movies..so it was nice to have walked around the shops a bit at nighttime.

I am literally sitting right now looking over my planner and mapping out how I will tackle all of the stuff. Stay tuned!
