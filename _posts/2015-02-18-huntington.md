**<span style="color: #bf005f; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: underline;">What I actually did on Sunday<span style="color: #bf005f; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">:**

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Went to church.

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Went to the Huntington Gardens with my awesome RAs and some friends.

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Picnicked there.

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Did some of my homework.



<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">Hey guys!

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">This past weekend brought even more gorgeous weather--I didn't know that was even possible! The lovely Avery RAs organized a trip to the <a href="https://www.huntington.org/" style="color: #bf005f;" target="_blank">Huntington Gardens</a>. I had been only once before for an exhibit on Archimedes during spring term of last year. The Huntington is actually within walking distance from campus, so I really should be going all the more.

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">We trekked through the Desert Garden, Japanese Garden, Chinese Garden, a greenhouse, and the Children's Garden...

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">It's easy to be lazy. It's easy to stay in bed all day and wear sweats and eat campus food and study. Before I came to Caltech as a frosh last year, though, I made up my mind to savor my mornings and visit coffee shops and gardens and bookstores and look decent at least three days a week. I want to buy groceries and cook and try my hand at all the things being on your own allows you to do.

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">That said, I'm still compiling a more complete version of the bucket list I began before coming here. That'll be in a post soon, so come back and check! And as always, don't forget to

<span style="color: #111111; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;">keep lookin' up,
