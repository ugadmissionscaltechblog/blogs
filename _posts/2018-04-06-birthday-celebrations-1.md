Most of us got various schnitzels for the main, and my boyfriend and I also got a pretzel and the weisswurst to share. It was my first time having the white sausage, and I thought it was pretty good :) I haven't had the real thing in Germany though, so I can't say if it was authentic or not.

For dessert, I got a free nutella pudding, and we also ordered the apple strudel for everyone to share.
