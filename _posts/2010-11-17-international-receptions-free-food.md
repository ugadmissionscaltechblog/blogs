It doesn't matter what university your'e attending- anything involving the words "international" and "food" is always guaranteed to be good. Every year at Caltech during third term, there's an international food fair where, for a dollar, you can sample foods from all over the world. I always come back to my room completely stuffed and ready to food coma. When I heard about the international reception this week, I definitely jumped at the opportunity to get a free meal comprised of yummy exotic foods, just like any good college student. The most interesting thing I noticed that was different between the one here, and the one at tech, was the countries represented. At tech, basically everyAsianculture was represented, making up the majority of the fair, while at Edinburgh we got to try things from Poland, Slovenia and many more European countries. Meanwhile at the Korean table, I could hear the Korean Student Association club member exasperatingly explaining to everyone who walked by how they weren't serving sushi, but kimbap, and that there *was*a difference. I felt bad for him. It makes sense that the two food fairs had focuses on different continents though, considering the demographic spread of the universities themselves. Enough about that though... onto the food! (: I didn't take too many pictures... but here's a good one to get your mouths watering.

The first thing I tried turned out to be horse meat, but I didn't find out until *after*I started eating it. I was a little mortified and my first reaction was "oh my god I'm eating myself" since I'm year of the horse. The worst part was it tasted pretty good. Err... well I guess I broadened my horizons to say the least, and that's what these things are for, right? x__x
