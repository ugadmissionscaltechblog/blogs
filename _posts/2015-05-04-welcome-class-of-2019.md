Freshman year has passed by so quickly — I repeatedly find myself surprised that events happened at my high school already. One of those milestone events was May 1. Last year, I was pretty set on attending Caltech after Early Action decisions, but for many people, the college decision struggle was real.

So here’s to all of you, from the ones who made their decision half a year ago, to the ones who flipped a coin on May 1 at 11:59 p.m. Whether that decision is Caltech or not, congratulations! And to the incoming Caltech class of 2019, WELCOME! We can’t wait to meet you all. Here’s a collage of members from the classes of 2015 to 2018 put together by the Instagram team:

And to those of you who are still in the throes of college visits and standardized testing of junior year, be strong. The best is yet to come. Also check out our <a href="https://instagram.com/caltechadmissions/" target="_self">Instagram</a>. We post lots of cool snapshots of Caltech life.
