...BECAUSE OTHERWISE THEY SURPRISE YOU BY REDECORATING YOUR ROOM!!!
Backstory: On Saturday the house cleaned all the random stuff out of our basement. Coincidentally, my roommate recently moved out, so my room was a little empty, since I have a very small amount of stuff. Anyway,I went home for the Easter weekend, and came back to find....

MY AMAZING FRIENDS WHO BROKE IN AND MADE EVERYTHING **AWESOME!!! Thank you to Connor, Anthony, Rachel, Corwin, and Caroline!! :) &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3**

The rug, lamp, microwave, and sofa all were recycled from the basement. In addition, my friends VACUUMED and CLEANED!!!

AHHHHH!!! Anyway, just had to share this real quick because I feel like I'm on Extreme Home Makeover or something. I'm floored that they would take the time to redo my **entire room**. MY FRIENDS ARE SO AWESOMEEEEEEE!!
Hope you all have a great week!
Love,
Lori
