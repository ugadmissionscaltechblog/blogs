For those of you who attended Pre-frosh Weekend a couple days ago, congrats! It's an exciting time for you, and I'm sure you're choosing between many amazing universities around the country.

For those of you who missed it, last Thursday, as part of pre-frosh weekend activities, the SURF office held an short information session for incoming pre-frosh.

The info session featured four current Caltech undergrads who have done research on campus (or abroad!), so students could get a feel for the kind of stuff we do here. Here are two of the panel members in case you didn't catch the SURF panel:

**How did you go about finding a SURF?** 

Freshman year, I just sent out three emails to different profs at the Tectonic Observatory at Caltech, the first one replying within 5 minutes at 2 am (turns out students AND profs have unconventional sleeping schedules at tech). My PI met with me and asked me what I was interested in. He then had his postdocs propose projects for me to choose from. Sophomore year, after talking to Maria Spiropulu about my interests, she agreed to take me and four other undergraduates to CERN.

**What specific research did you do during your SURFs? **

My first SURF
 was in mathematical geophysics where I derived elastostatic solutions 
for realistic stress on shear cracks, basically deriving new Green's 
functions that were more accurate for modeling the stress surrounding 
any fault. It was really fun since I was the only undergraduate in the 
lab and everyone was paying attention to me. I also went to present at 
the Southern California Earthquake Conference, where I was the only 
undergraduate presenting, and I continued work throughout the year in 
the same lab to finish up a paper.

My sophomore year I
 worked with the CMS experiment and my project was measuring the energy 
resolution for the electromagnetic calorimeter, ECAL, of the detector 
which relates directly to the mass resolution of the Higgs Boson in its 
decay into two photons. I really enjoyed the summer and decided to go 
into Particle Physics. I am still working with the group and am working 
on preparing a senior thesis with the HEP group as well as returning to 
CERN this summer to work on a new project in multi-model inferencing 
with applications to High Energy Particle Physics. Caltech students were the
 youngest people there, since CERN usually only takes on third years and older. I arrived the week the 
Higgs Boson discovery was announced and was interviewed by an Italian 
news station, even though I had no clue what was going on. Working at 
CERN was pretty intense but tons of fun being in an international 
environment and working in a highly publicized field with the Higgs 
project.

**Anything you wish you'd known about SURF as a frosh?**

I wish I had known before the application 
process that there are in fact research positions in any field for 
freshmen, including physics, and that I should have been more 
comfortable just asking within the department.

**How did you go about finding a SURF?**

I knew I wanted to work in Professor Harry Gray's lab so I contacted him via email, discussed potential projects in person, and picked a project that interested me! When I was new in lab as a sophomore, the opportunity to 
workcloselywith a postdoc mentor helped me learn my way around the lab
 very quickly. Even my PI, Professor Gray, was accessible; it was 
encouraging to me that he cared so much about how my (and other 
undergraduates) projects were progressing. As a third term junior, I am much more independent and integrated into the lab.

**What does your research entail?**

I work with a postdoc on synthesizing and characterizing cobalt 
complexes to catalyze the reaction that produces hydrogen gas. We are 
interested in this reaction and the capabilities of these metal 
catalysts because hydrogen is a clean, renewable fuel source.

**What have you learned through SURF?**

I gained a lot of valuable experience in synthesis, since I had to
 spend a significant amount of time making the triphosphorus ligands for
 our complexes. I also
 learned about different characterization methods like electrochemistry,
 mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography.

**What opportunities has SURF provided for you?**

I am very grateful to SURF for getting me started in Harry's group. The best part about SURFing
 most definitely has been all of the people I had theopportunityto get
 to know and the impact it has had on me personally for my future. 
Through SURF arose many other opportunities that
 carried on into the year. I was able to continue with my research (and 
am getting ready to publish a paper!) and I also found a joined a 
chemistry outreach program
 run by members of Harry's group. These were opportunities I would have 
never had without the SURF I had that summer.
