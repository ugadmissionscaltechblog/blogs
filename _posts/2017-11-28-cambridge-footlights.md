The Cambridge Footlights, officially theCambridge University Footlights Dramatic Club, hosts student-run comedy sketch shows throughout the term. Actually, the Footlights has several famous former members, including Hugh Laurie.

I went to a smoker, which is a mix of sketches and stand-up. It was one of my first comedy shows, and certainly my first student-run smoker. Some of the performers were pretty funny, and it was really fun to go to.

I love that these shows are hosted regularly throughout the term; it's a great way to have fun and just relax. Plus, it's so easy to just walk 10 or 15 minutes to the ADC Theatre, buy a ticket, and sit down for a good time.

One of my favorite aspects about Cambridge is that the societies and clubs are so active; at Caltech, most clubs meet very few times per term, but here, there are regular shows like these, concerts, hikes, or just fun social gatherings. There's always something to do, even if it's not hosted by a society. It's so easy to walk around town, buy things at the market (I'll write a post about the market soon!), go shopping, or anything. If you get the chance to study abroad, I'd highly recommend it!
