Hong Kong is indeed known for shopping, maybe because their history is not as large, long, and as impressive as Chinaâ€™s. While they do have amazing shopping complexes, with a lot of high end brands with stores all over, there are similarly many street markets. You can find a lot of small stalls in side streets, as well as stalls that set up during the evening and night specifically. A lot of the side streets have small stalls that sell fresh produce, all for very cheap (and most likely locally grown as well). It's very interesting to see cheap prices for the foods when I am used to super expensive organic locally grown products.
