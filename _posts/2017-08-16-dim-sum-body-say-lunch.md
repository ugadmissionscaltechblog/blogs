Today I went out for dim sum for lunch at [Full House in Arcadia](https://www.yelp.com/biz/full-house-seafood-restaurant-arcadia). You know this is an authentic dim sum location since all the patrons are Chinese and there's a fish tank with a $1000 fish in the entrance. Although the fish is unbelievably pricey, the actual dishes were very affordable. This was also a push-cart style restaurant so there is no wait time for dishes to come out of the kitchen.


We ordered way too much, but it's okay since dim sum makes great take away that can be stored in the fridge for breakfast for days. We ordered every possible sort of bao and dumplings, pig ears, pork blood, tripe, peking duck, roast duck and roast pork, along with a variety of other classic dim sums.

We had a friend come along who has never had dim sum before and we were all super proud of him for trying all the dishes, including jellyfish and other lesser known animal parts. Better yet, he loved most of it! If you aren't an experienced dim sum eater, you are probably super confused by this point. In short, it's like tapas style breakfast/lunch dishes. If you are interested in learning more about the most popular dishes, here is [a brief guide by Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/2011/04/guide-to-dim-sum-dumplings-siu-mai-bao-chinese-steamed-buns.html).


Let's be real, the Chinese were brunching before brunch was cool. They've been doing it for centuries! For the cost, I would rather eat a dozen shrimp dumplings and radish cakes over 2 pancakes. One downside of dim sum is the wait at the restaurant can get pretty long on the weekends, but I think it's worth it, especially when enjoyed family style with a group of friends!
