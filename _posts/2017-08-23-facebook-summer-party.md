One of the greatest things about being an intern at Facebook is that they will treat you like a full-time employee in everything but benefits. So this event, the Summer Party, is put on for their employees - especially those with families - so that they may enjoy a day off with their kids. I can say this with such certainty (despite having only gone to one Summer Party) because of the sheer number of little ones around at the event. Although this is the target audience, many if not most of the employees at the office go. At least, enough went such that there was a full basket of Madeleines in one of the micro-kitchens by the end of the day - and those things are usually gone by noon.
