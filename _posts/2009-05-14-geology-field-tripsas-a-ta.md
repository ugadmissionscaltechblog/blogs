Hi everyone,
As a freshman, sophomore, and junior major in Geobiology, I had to take several classes which required field trips. As a result of my being in the department, I have been able to travel (free of charge!) to Croatia, Venice, Australia, Hawaii, Baja Mexico, the Ridge Basin, and just recently the Grand Canyon. The difference was, for this last weekend, I was a TA, because I'm TA'ing an "Introduction to Geology" course called Ge1. Their field trip is to the Grand Canyon, and the TAs got to go along to help maintain order among the frosh (mostly, we carried the gear from place to place...but it wasn't too much, only some posterboards and a cooler!!).

This was the last big trip I will take as a senior though, for free at the expense of Caltech Geology Department at least...let's hope they like alumni coming back to visit :)
