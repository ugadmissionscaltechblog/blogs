<span style="color: #c00000; font-size: 18px;">Hey, y'all!So I've been really slow to update lately, mostly because of Finals' Week and Spring Break (which, if you read Dannah's blog, has been busy, too!). Our final class was about southern cooking, which was something I've never actually cooked before! It's so delicious, though, that I was really excited to learn some tricks of the trade. We had some guests explain how they make traditional southern fare, like biscuits and pulled pork. I never realized how much work went into barbecue (and BBQ is NOT the same as a grill), and that made the final product taste even better! We actually did not have the chance to cook a lot of meat (because it takes so many hours, so they made it for us).

And after cooking up applesauce, biscuits, greens, and some other accompaniments, it was time to EAT. But before that, we got schooled on the details of BBQ sauce (we had over 5 types to choose from!) and how different states do BBQ (Tom showed us a really funny video to explain it, but I can't find it - maybe I will soon). But most importantly, it was time to EAT! Delicious, of course. And we also had a lot of visitors enjoying our food, too! Tom said there were over 70 people crammed into his house that night!
Having trouble visualizing...? Time for pictures!
