I’m relatively obsessed with Tasty; I watch a ton of their videos (sometimes multiple times), and if that wasn’t enough, I even have the app - it’s the first sign of madness. So I’ve made some of their recipes before, but nothing as ambitious or as obviously “Tasty” as the Chicken Parm Lasagna Roll Ups.
