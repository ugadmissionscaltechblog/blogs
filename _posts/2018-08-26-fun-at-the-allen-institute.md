At the Allen Institute this summer, there are 16 science interns and 2 admin (HR and finance) interns! There are several who either go to UW or are local, but there's also a decent number of people who are from outside of state. I've met people from Cornell, NYU, Reed, and Columbia.

For the world cup, we had a world cup viewing party and potluck!

There's also magnetic scrabble pieces next to the cafe, and people have been putting up food themed words :P I added ube and rhubarb!

Every Thursday from 4-5pm, we have tea and treats, where the cafe staff prepare a special tea and put out biscuits for us. It's really nice and relaxing to hang out with everyone and just drink tea :)
