Hello everyone,
For my first post, I thought I would write a short little introduction just to get a feel for the process.

My name is Kyle Verdone, I'm 22 years old, and I'm a senior in Ruddock House. I'm majoring in Business, Economics, and Management and planning on getting a job in finance after graduation in June.

I'm an the Athletic Managers for my house, a Tour Guide Captain, and the official Caltech Cheermaster. In my free time, I'm a fan of sports and weightlifting, dance parties, funny movies and TV shows, and making everything I do fun and entertaining.

If you have any questions for me at all, I'll be happy to answer them in the commments section, or you can email me at kverdone@caltech.edu.
