Today I went to Koreatown with my friend Gabriela, a SURF student from Brazil. The Koreatown of LA is the biggest of any American city. The food here is THE BOMBDOTCOM. You can ask any Uber driver. Gabriela was eager to try authentic Korean food, and I needed to go for a touch up for my eyebrows.

Why go into K-town for eyebrows you ask? Well, first let me explain microblading, which is super trendy these days. If you already know what I am talking about, skip this paragraph. Essentially, microblading is a semi-permanent eyebrow tattoo. Hair-like strokes are draw with a thin blade to mimic natural hairs. The ink doesn't go as deep as ink for a typical tattoo. Numbing cream is used so it's not that painful. Results last up to two years before touch ups are needed. Here is a Buzzfeed video on the experience.

I decided to get my eyebrows microbladed because I have naturally thin eyebrows and it saves me so much time to not have to fill them in. Also, I can rub my face, sweat and swim without makeup streaking across my face.

The salon I went to is super intimate and cute. The set up can seem intimidating and the color options can be overwhelming, but an experienced eyebrow artist will help you through all of it.

Voila, the results! My eyebrows will scab a bit this week and the stokes will fade in color overtime. In the meantime, they are on fleek :)

If you are reading this post just for the food, here is the delicious bibimbap that was enjoyed along with some banchan (side-dishes) at <a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/hangari-bajirak-kalgooksoo-los-angeles-6">Hangari Bajirak Kalgooksoo</a> restaurant. We will be back soon to try their hand-cut noodles.

Afterwards, we went grocery shopping at Zion Market. Asian grocery stores are so much cheaper than Vons or Pavillions etc. I bought 2 lbs of organic grapes for $1.49. Grapes are especially delicious when frozen -- the perfect healthy snack.
