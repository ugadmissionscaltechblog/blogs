This past week was super eventful! I not only tried the (in)famous Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccinos, but also I went to The Grove in Beverly Hills for the first time and went to my friend's graduation show at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.

Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino - I love all things unicorn, so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to try this. My friends and I even brought our unicorn headbands to the store. There is a Starbucks within walking distance, so a couple of my friends and I went one afternoon. We all got the same thing, and none of us liked it very much. I would describe thetaste as alternating between light hints of mango and very sour candy. It wasn't what I expected at all - I thought it was going to be a sugar overload (maybe I would have liked that better). I'm glad I was able to try it though, since Starbucks only offered the unique flavor for a few days.

The Grove - The Grove is an outdoor shopping mall in Beverly Hills. It's beautiful! I went because I was cravingLadur√©e macarons*.*I had had their macarons before from London and Paris, but they only recently just opened up some stores in Southern California. I tried their orange blossom, geranium, lily of the valley, rose petal, chocolate black currant, Cognac, and salted caramel macarons. The first four tasted too much like soap for my liking, but the last three were amazing! Additionally, the Snapchat Spectacles vending machine was also at the Grove this past weekend. I didn't end up getting a pair though.

Art Center Graduation - The Art Center College of Design is an art school in Pasadena. One of my friends from high school went there, and she just graduated this past Saturday! I went to her graduation showcase to see both her work and the work of all the graduating Art Center students. The showcase were huge and everyone was extremely talented. It was open to the public, so anyone interested could have gone. P.S. Caltech has an exchange program with the Art Center College of Design!
