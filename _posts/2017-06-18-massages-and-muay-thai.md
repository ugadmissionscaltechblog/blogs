In this post I'm going to highlight a couple of great experiences I had this past week. Both are located in Pasadena and are pretty close to campus, so if you think you will ever be in the mood for a relaxing massage or some serious martial arts kickboxing, read on!
$25 massages at [HM Warm Spa](https://www.yelp.com/biz/hm-warm-spa-pasadena) on Green St:
HM Warm Spa is clean and spacious. The $25 "foot massage" is actually a full body massage. This massage is done with the clients' clothes left on. They start by soaking your feet in a tub of warm water. They then proceed to massage your face, head, shoulders, arms, legs, and feet. Then they flip you over to massage your upper and lower back. The entire procedure lasts for an hour and is performed in a dark room. They bring you a cup of water after the massage. They do a great job for an awesome price. Don't forget to tip - I would recommend at least a $10 tip.
