As the recently elected Social Chairman of Fleming House, I am in charge of organizing weekend social events for Fleming. This past weekend we had a Valentine's dress dinner, for which Tom Mannion cooked. If you haven't heard of Tom Mannion, his official title is Senior Director for Student Activities and Programs, but we like to call him the Senior Director for Student Happiness because that's exactly what he does. He's also an outsanding cook and the instructor for the cooking class that I'm currently taking.

Our dinner had a fantastic meal, including an heirloom tomato tart, a choice of prime rib, scallops and lobster tail, pan seared duck, and mushroom and paremsan risotto, and then a Fleming crested chocolate mousse cake for dessert. It was delicious!
Here is the wonderful setup that our Social Team put together in our dining hall for the dinner:
Here are the sophomore girls of Fleming House all dressed up!

The dinner was a great event, and I think everyone had a good time. We had a huge turnout: 54 guests! And it was a lot of fun seeing everyone dressed up, since we don't always look this good :).
