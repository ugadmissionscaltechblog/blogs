Although this is a blog about our adventures on the road, I wanted to let everyone see what we saw today from campus. The Space Shuttle Endeavor flew over [Caltech](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/) and [JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/) on its way to its new home at the [California Science Center](https://www.californiasciencecenter.org/)! This is the view from the 9th floor of Millikan Library.
