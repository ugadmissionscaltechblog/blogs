Although this is a blog about our adventures on the road, I wanted to let everyone see what we saw today from campus. The Space Shuttle Endeavor flew over <a href="https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/" target="_self">Caltech</a> and <a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_self">JPL</a> on its way to its new home at the <a href="https://www.californiasciencecenter.org/" target="_self">California Science Center</a>! This is the view from the 9th floor of Millikan Library.
