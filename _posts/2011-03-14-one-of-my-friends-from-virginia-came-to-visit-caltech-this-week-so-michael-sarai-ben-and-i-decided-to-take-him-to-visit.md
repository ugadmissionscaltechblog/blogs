One of my friends from Virginia came to visit Caltech this week, so  Michael, Sarai, Ben, and I decided to take him to visit Los Angeles.  First, we stopped by Chinatown, where we found a random restaurant to  eat. We were sitting next to an aquarium with fishes, two of which were  kissing...a couple of us found it rather amusing, but I didn't get a  picture of it. Anyway, the food was also amazing, it was nice to get  some Chinese food once in a while.

Afterwards, we made our way to  Little Tokyo, where I've been to many many times. They have a lot of stores. Some sell cute Asian mechandise, such as  totoros and domos. One such store have new things every time I go --  they sell out so quickly. This time there were awesome hamtaros that  vibrates when you pull on their tails. There are also stores that sell  more traditional Asian things such as fans, etc. For anime lovers, there  are two stores that sell imported anime and manga merchandise from  Japan. Finally, there are also a lot of Japanese restaurants and snack  places. The street side snack shops are especially awesome, they sell  snacks like takoyaki and mochi ice cream.

All of you probably  know about the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan recently. To raise  awareness and funding to help Japan, there was a charity event on  Saturday. There were performances throughout the day and many volunteers  walked around with boxes getting donations. I'm proud to say that we  contributed :)
