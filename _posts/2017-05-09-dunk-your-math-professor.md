In the spring, Caltech holds its annual Grad Fair for its graduating students.

Seniors are also encouraged to donate to the senior gift to the school in the form of a dunk tank featuring student leaders from all the houses and even Professor Nets Katz who taught us our very first Caltech math class and our new Dean, Kevin Gilmartin.

There are various booths offering to sell diploma frames, class rings, invitations to commencement and so on. Others also gave out freebies.

Students buy their cap, gown, tassel and stole from the bookstore, and then take graduation photos outside in the study area in Winnett. The photographers provide cap and gown, and even a fake dress shirt collar for men, for the photographs.

Several other booths also were there, such as the Pasadena March for Science signing and also a Microsoft Surface booth set up by a student ambassador with free donuts and Microsoft goodies.
