Here are a couple *belated* pictures from my awesome weekend on Amy's real Texas ranch!
When we arrived, we went on a tour of the 44-acre property and saw the garden, pastures, 2 ponds, and COWS! Then we got to spend some time shooting clay pigeons in one of the pastures and hanging out by the ponds. Amy built a floating hammock/raft with her dad and brother earlier this year - it can be seen in some of the pictures below. They did all the buoyancy and force calculations to make sure it would float and not easily capsize. 
It was awesome to get to see parts of the Texas country - definitely different than Houston!
Here are some pictures!
