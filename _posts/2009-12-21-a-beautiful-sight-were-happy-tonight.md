Two bloggers in D.C.!

Sarah rushed over right before we left on our shuttle to the airport, and I'm so glad we got to see her for a bit. Am also thankful that our flights left D.C. on Friday night, because the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2009/US/weather/12/20/winter.weather/index.html">huge snowstorm</a> that grounded all the planes hit the East Coast on Saturday. Hope all of you on the other coast are staying safe!
After arriving at home and sleeping for a consecutive 14 hours, I'm feeling much more refreshed, but also a bit sad that the week in D.C. has ended. For the photographer in me, the area is absolutely beautiful and I would love to visit again in the future. And as a scientist, I've learned much more information about the regulation and government policies behind the work that we're doing - and that there is a different field of science that we can explore beyond research in graduate school or elsewhere. Walking in a science wonderland has been amazing, but coming home is very much needed. 
Now to sort through the hundreds of pictures I've taken...
