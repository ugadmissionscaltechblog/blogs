At Caltech, there are 4 different a cappella groups: Out of Context, a mixed gender group; Fluid Dynamics, another mixed gender group (and the oldest group at Caltech); the Pipettes, a women only group; and the Keytones, our men only group. Each term they have a concert for all of the groups to perform their current songs. The Spring term concert - Acapalooza - is the most special to the groups because the seniors are graduating and will have to say goodbye.

All of the seniors in all of the groups sang solos. They choose a wide range and a great mix of songs, from Ring of Fire to Wake Me Up. Because there are students from all of the houses in the a cappella groups, there always a large turnout. A ton of people came to cheer on their friends and seniors. I know someone in every group, and more often I knew quite a few from the groups. I always enjoy listening to the a cappella groups, because their harmonizing is amazing. As someone who can't do harmonies, I'm in awe of their talent.
