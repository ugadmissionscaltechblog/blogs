My workplace, the Allen Institute, is located in the South Lake Union district of Seattle. Most of the buildings around there are Amazon buildings, and this building below is one of them. These are the Amazon spheres, which were constructed as a space for Amazon employees to relax. Inside, there's a greenhouse/garden area. It's open to the public every other Saturday, with limited tickets, so I'll try to snag a ticket while I'm here!

This is the Amazon Go store, where you walk in, scan your phone in the Amazon Go app to enter, take your grocery items, and walk out. You get charged a few hours later. We tried buying a hi-chew, and we were surprised at first when we didn't get charged, but it turns out we got charged later in the day.

Afterwards, we walked to downtown and Pike Place Market, although it was closed for the day. At this point, it was almost 9, and it was still bright outside! I guess it's summer, but I didn't realize the sun sets*that* late.

I'm looking forward to exploring Seattle a lot more this summer! It's my first time living right in a city, so it's very exciting :)
