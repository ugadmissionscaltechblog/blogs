Time for Renegade Craft Fair #3! I've been to the one in SF and the one in LA, so I was excited to hear that the fair was coming to Seattle for a weekend. Like the SF fair, it was held in an old warehouse, although this fair was much smaller than the one in SF (and about the same size as the one in LA).

As usual, there were a lot of cute crafts :) I ended up buying a pine cone pin from the shop below for my denim jacket!

So far, the craft fair in SF has been my favorite, mostly because it was the biggest, so it had the most variety. But I plan to keep coming to more in the future. I love these cute, unique artist items!
