The Computer History Museum is about the innovation that went into machines, and their evolution over time. It's always very interesting to me because the timeline for the museum is really ridiculous - from the start of the main exhibit, there is an abacus, which goes straight into machines such as type writers. But modern(ish) computers don't really start until World War II, and their advancement accelerates so drastically starting from the 1970s that it's almost comical. It's really so surprising to see iPods from 2001 displayed in a museum, simply because technology has advanced so fast.
