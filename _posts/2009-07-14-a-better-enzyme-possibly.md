I finally have some good news! Even though my initial screen of the 3000 mutants did not yield any improvement, my secondary screen with 1600 mutants ended up going much better. I got a mutant that gave me 37% better performance than my parent (original) enzyme, and a couple of other that were in the 20s in percentage improvement.
