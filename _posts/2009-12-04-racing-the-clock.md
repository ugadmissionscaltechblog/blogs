Right now, I am blogging from the SFL library on the first floor...and I probably shouldn't be...

It is 3pm right now, and I have a homework set due at 5pm! YIKES...my heart is kind of racing, I'm typing like a maniac and chugging coffee....


![](/old_images/caltech_as_it_happens/6a0105349b8251970b0120a713c336970b.jpg)Don't worry too much though, since I only have one problem left (I worked last night until 4am with my study group)...and now we are cramming to finish up before we need to run it in.


![](/old_images/caltech_as_it_happens/6a0105349b8251970b01287616199f970c.jpg)I am not used to working on a set a few hours before it's due---I'm usually the "finish it up the night before" kind of girl...but CDS110 has made me succumb this term.

Other great news?!?--It is the last day of classes for the term--and MY LAST SET FOR THE TERM! WOOHOO!!!
and to make things even better---bc my next (and last!) two terms are super chill, I have a feeling this will be one of the last times I will be scurrying to finish up sets or working really late into the night. :D so there's lots to be happy about...

except for next week....FINALS!!!
