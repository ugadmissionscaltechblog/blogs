The Caltech Y is an organization on campus that hosts various extracurricular activities including tutoring, hiking and camping trips, volunteering, and more. Decompression is an event they host on the last day of classes every term. At Decompression, there's dinner, sometimes a movie, and other various events to help de-stress.

During lunch, the Caltech Y dog was there to help advertise for the Y :)

In the afternoon, there were puppies! There was also live music and food, but people were mostly gathered around for the puppies. They were so energetic and cute and so so small.
