Then, on the train back to London, I learned of a few more UCL traditions. For each game, the team votes a "man" and a "wanker." The man is essentially the game's MVP, while the wanker is either the clumsiest, ditzy-est or LeastVP. It seemed too mean to vote someone wanker, so I nominated myself. Luckily, though I did not get it! Otherwise I would be required to wash the whole team's smelly uniforms! Gross.

After I avoided uniform duty, it was back to studying during the train ride. There is tons of reading to do at UCL, which is how I'll be spending my time until our next game on Wednesday. Hopefully we can keep this good luck going!
