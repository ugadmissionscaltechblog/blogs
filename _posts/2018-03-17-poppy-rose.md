Last weekend, I went to get brunch in downtown LA at Poppy + Rose, which is right next to the flower market district. There were stalls selling various foods, orange juice, and flowers, along with a lot of flower shops on the street.

There was a long line for brunch! We got the rib tips breakfast burrito, the pulled pork hash, and a waffle a la carte, which were all yummy. I thought the waffle was especially good. This place is known for their chicken + waffle, so next time I'll try that :)
