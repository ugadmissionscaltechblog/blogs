Hey,So last weekend was really fun! Well, I mean, there were definitely some boring parts, but for the most part I enjoyed myself.During some of the boring times, I just hung out with friends. And sure, just hanging out can be pretty boring, but it's way better than just bumming on the computer by yourself. :) Oh! and something we did was watch Youtube videos and I was actually enlightened by a few of them.... Basically, we had a Justin Bieber section of our boredom when we were looking at funny stuff involving him. One of them was this video:
<p align="center" class="asset asset-video" style="margin: 0pt auto; display: block;"><object height="306" width="500"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/DkKqihEUmH4&amp;fs=1" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" height="306" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/DkKqihEUmH4&amp;fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="500" /></object>
After watching this I was like "Wow. What's our world coming to when our pop stars don't even know what German means!" Umph. Oh wells. I guess we can just file him with the tons of other famous people who don't know basic things. (: Also, if you're super bored you should also check out:<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTCm8tdHkfI" target="_blank">3 Year old crying over Justin Bieber</a>. This made me laugh soo much. It's crazy how crazy some people are. Ha!Anyways, onto some events that happened over the weekend. This summer, there's a group of students who are on the SURF SAC committee. These people help put on events that are open to summer students and are free! The event on Saturday was a Luau pool party! However, I was being a bum in my room so I didn't go out the pool part of the party. But, knowing me, I made sure I was in time for the food! :D At first I felt a little bad that I was only going there for the food, but since I also had to take pictures and there were other people just coming for the food, I no longer felt bad. :)
