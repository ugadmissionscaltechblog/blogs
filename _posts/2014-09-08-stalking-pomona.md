With Friday, August 22nd came the termination of SURF. And so I went home and began my summer vacation for real. As in away from Caltech. (More will follow about my second half of SURF, but in a later post. I apologize for my anachronistic style.)

On Sunday the 24th, we went to drop my brother Leonard off at Pomona College. As a semester school, they get to start a whole month before we do. That being said, they also end about a whole month before we do. Not judging about which is better, but all I know is that I'm going to have a weird month at home without the ever-present little brother this summer.

We began driving at 6 am (definitely not my thing) in order to reach campus by 7:40. Then there was a hustle for my brother to register his name, while my mom and I went to the rummage sale to pick up a microwave and a fan--because, apparently, Leonard's dorm only has one microwave and it's located all the way in the basement level.

After multiple near-misses, we finally met the roommate, who comes from Germany and seemed quite chill. Introductions were made between the parents, room arrangements were discussed, and we all went to lunch.

^Early impressions: Pomona is awfully fond of square plates...

^A note on the wildlife: Their squirrels are skinnier than the Caltech squirrels! Perhaps we are too generous with ours (all those olive trees and their fruits must've raised their lipid intake or *something*). Pomona squirrels are not only able to climb trees but also scale buildings!

The rest of the day was the usual convocation speech and question-and-answer panels that comes with all first days at college (and yes, I am most definitely justified in making such a generalization after going through two college orientations). A noteworthy moment: they kicked all of the parents and family members out after 5 pm, under the pretense of treating them to a delicious reception involving coconut shrimp, blackberry-infused cheeses, and strawberry parfait desserts. You devious devil, you, Pomona College!

So it was that I came away one little brother short and several camera-phone masterpieces richer on the 22nd of August, 2014. 

But we didn't go home to stew over our loss--not at all. We went on vacation.

Till next time!
