Including myself, there are also two other Techers that are interning here in Houston with Schlumberger. Here I am pictured with Stassy and Joules, outside of the intern orientation and training days we completed this week. All 3 of us are rising seniors at Caltech majoring in Mechanical Engineering. Joules works in a different Schlumberger center across town, and stays in a different housing location. Stassy and I both work in SRC, and live two doors away from one another.

At the training center, we sat through presentations about various company policies. Though the two days of training were tedious, we had the opportunity to meet the other interns from other centers and also participated in a team building competition. The design competition involved building a structure that supported 12 C batteries using a limited amount of paper and tape. The rules and guidelines were very specific, and had factors for the structure that helped your team earn points and determine the winner.

SRC shuts down the office all of next week---which means I get a whole week off and paid vacation! When I discovered that I would get time off of work, I booked a flight to Baltimore, Maryland for about 6 days to visit some of my relatives and celebrate my cousin's graduation from college. I am super excited and am leaving very early Saturday morning. So from now until Thursday, I will be on vacation-- but I will be sure to blog about my time on the east coast while I'm there!
