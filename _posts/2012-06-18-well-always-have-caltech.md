Finals week has come to a close, not with a bang, but not with a whimper either. It was closer to a "meh," really. Regardless, its time to wrap up third term and the year, and what better way than graduation?

Cue the pictures (thanks to a resident junior, Nina Budaeva)!

A happy Daniil Kitchaev of Blacker House with a happy tassel.

Russel Newman of Lloyd House moving his tassel. Those things look fun.

So yeah, just a picture post this time around. Its been quite a blast this last year with the seniors, now alumni. Now they disperse into the real world, respected degrees in hand. With that, I hope they can come back and remember this place, for all the good times and bad. As Elon Musk said, "You are the magicians of the 21st century...go out and make some magic."
