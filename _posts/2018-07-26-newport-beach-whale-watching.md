Just a 2 hour drive away from Caltech is the sleepy town of Newport Beach, where you can go whale watching for $15-20! It's a really cute and quiet town, with a nice calm vibe. It was my first time going whale watching since I was a kid, so I was pretty excited.

I don't have the right camera for this, but you can see a spout of water come out from the ocean in the distance! We saw maybe 3-4 gray whales on this outing. Sometimes people also see dolphins, and different species of whales come around at different times of the year.

We also saw a bunch of sea lions lounging on a buoy.

Newport Beach is really a super nice town. It has such a nice vibe I didn't want to leave :)
