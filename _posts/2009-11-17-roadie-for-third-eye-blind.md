Yup--you read right...I was a roadie for a day for THIRD EYE BLIND this past Saturday!! They came to play a concert for our campus November 14th!!
Woke up early on Saturday to volunteer some man power to help set-up the stage and unload the equipment trucks. Was super psyched to see that the band's tour bus was parked right outside, across the street from my dorm room!!

It ran so smoothly, we finished ahead of schedule and got to hang out with the band's roadies.
