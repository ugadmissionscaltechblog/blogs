**Disclaimer**

This is really rushed, so most of this will likely be pictures. Again, please go to Panoramio for more and better pictures: [https://www.panoramio.com/user/2916748/tags/Japan&amp;comments_page=1&amp;photos_page=6](https://www.panoramio.com/user/2916748/tags/Japan&amp;comments_page=1&amp;photos_page=6) and h[ttp://www.panoramio.com/user/2916748/tags/Japan&amp;comments_page=1&amp;photos_page=7](ttp://www.panoramio.com/user/2916748/tags/Japan&amp;comments_page=1&amp;photos_page=7)

More pictures when I get back from Nagano on Wednesday.

**Gifu**

Gifu is a mountainous prefecture north of Aichi, perhaps famous for the World Heritage site Shirakawa-go. I went with some other kids to Gujo Hachiman, a small mountain town. There, we were able to go to Kawashima Aqua Aquarium, Gujo Hachiman Castle, a Fake Food producer, and Otaki Shonyudo, which is a large underground cave. Pictures below:

**Nagoya**

Nagoya is the third largest city in Japan, located to the northwest of Okazaki. While at Nagoya, I visited some parks, some shrines, the Nagoya TV tower, the Nagoya Dome, and the Nagoya Port. Pictures below:

Again, this is all rushed, so if you want more details, please comment. Many more pictures on Panoramio! Also, Iâ€™ve taken about 1000 pictures so far, but I can only host so many on Panoramio. If you want specific or more detailed pictures, please just request them and I will see if I have them. Thanks.
