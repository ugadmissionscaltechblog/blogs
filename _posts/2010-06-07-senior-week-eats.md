What now? I've finished my senior year..and have a few days until graduation.

First...is relaxing and playing with my new iPad (it's incredible, by the way)
Then were some senior receptions these past few days:
Ice cream social for the admissions office--PS: we moved! The admissions office moved a few weeks ago from Steele House to 383 S Hill over by the President's House and the Einstein Papers House.

I was telling everyone that the last time just our class sat down to have a meal together was probably during rotation of Freshman Year when we first arrived. The food was so yummy...and the desserts were even prettier.

I've also been starting on the tedious task of packing up my room and selling some of my stuff (appliances, dorm room stuff) to underclassmen. That and getting prepared for my new job is keeping me busy.

I'll keep you guys updated
