I know I should have gone to go see the monuments, but it was really cold and I was still very tired. Something about all the activities during the day tired me out a lot. So, by the end of the days all I wanted to so was just pass out. And that's basically what I did. I got back, took a shower then slept. I was thouroughly excited for our last day though. We would be heading to the National Institute of Health! I'll tell you about this and what I got from this trip in the final post.Until then,Mario
