A chitenje is the multipurpose, can't-do-without, colorful piece of cloth every Malawian woman has got!
It's a rectangular piece of fabric used as a wrap over a skirt, to carry children, as a shawl in the cold or rain, and as a head wrapping. All the village women wear them, they are far less common in the city as professional women wear uniforms or current western fashions.

Being stuck in doors with all the rain the past few days, my fellow volunteers and I constructed a chitenje wearing tutorial!

The scenery was beautiful, but the only "wildlife" I could see were goats!
