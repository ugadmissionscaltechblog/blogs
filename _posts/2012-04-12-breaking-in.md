I’m Kayane, a Prefrosh from Irvine, California. I’m enjoying my Prefrosh experience so much, and I look forward to all the fun and great activities coming up tonight! I’m living in the moment for the next two days, away from the worries of school and academics! So far I’ve visited two classes, absorbing as much as I can from a new environment. I’ve made many new friends, some of whom I’ll see at Caltech in the fall. Enjoy! :)
