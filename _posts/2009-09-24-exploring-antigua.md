It was back to Antigua for us for the rest of our trip. We spent the days driving to the work sites to work on our projects, and the nights going out in Antigua.

The city was so pretty and historic, I felt like I was in a different world when I walked around. I was happy that we got a chance to be tourists in addition to working on the research. Of course, I did some more shopping in the markets and ate at a lot of great restaurants. 
But the days flew by, and before we knew it, the 4 days in Antigua came to an end so fast. Here are pictures from the time we spent sightseeing around Antigua.
