On June 8-9th, there was an event in Pasadena called the [626 Night Market (NM)](https://www.626nightmarket.com/). 626 is the area code for Pasadena. In their own words, the 626 NM is an "Asian food themed night market that showcases a variety of local businesses, entrepreneurs, and artists." This event started last year, and it's based on the existing night markets in Taiwan (and other parts of Asia). At 626 NM, you can eat all sorts of yummy foods, see live performances, and buy art/random merchandise.

It would be a bit image heavy if I included all the pictures here, so I complied a few into a GIF below:
