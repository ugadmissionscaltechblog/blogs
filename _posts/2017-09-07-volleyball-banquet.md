To celebrate the beginning of our volleyball season, Tom Mannion offered to hold an opening banquet for us on the first Saturday of preseason. Tom is the Director of Student Activities and Programs at Caltech and often opens his home to welcome students, especially on weekends. He always has food for the students who can come, and there is always too much of it. So we were especially excited to request the types of food that we enjoy, things like sushi, curry, fruits, and brownies
