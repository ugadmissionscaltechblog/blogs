**Hi!I apologize for the massive delay between the last post and this - I've been making my final trips to help me make the decision that will define the next 8 years of my life! My first foray was to Seattle to revisit the University of Washington! It was another busy couple days both meeting more professors and students, while also getting some extra time to see the city! Though, again, I didn't go UP the Space Needle, I got to see it. And then I ate some delicious salmon at Ivar's (a famous small chain in the city). I also met some AWESOME people from other schools who are deciding where to go, and some others who had already committed! Enjoy the pictures from my time up there!

That was a bit of a longer flight, but then I arrived in Ann Arbor in time for dinner! The revisit group bonded pretty quickly, and there were more AWESOME potential classmates. We got to tour a lot of the facilities and even see the helicopter land! And, of course, I got to see more faculty. As a bonus, I even got to go home and see family for the weekend! Overall, a really nice trip, too! Sorry I don't have too many pictures, but here's the helicopter!!

The title of this post is "Decided!" so I have officially matriculated. And the final choice? Well, I'm going to...

THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN

Yup, that's right, I'll be in Ann Arbor, MI for the next 8 (or so) years! So how did I make this decision (because I know some of you probably are making one now)? Well, honestly I went with my heart. It sounds kind of corny but where did I get the best feeling from? Where could I see myself living for the next stage of my life? Where did the people match up best with my personality? Those are the questions I asked myself, and those are the ones you should be asking, too! Don't focus on rankings or names, because if you do and you end up somewhere for the wrong reasons, you may second-guess yourself for the rest of your life. And remember, if you're so lucky to have a choice, you really can't make a wrong one. Best of luck to all of you who are deciding, and I hope that all of you come to Caltech if it's the right place for you (I know it has been for me)!
