Our senior trip was to Las Vegas. The whole thing cost each person about $20. Lodging, transportation and a dinner show were all included in this fee, thanks to generous subsidies.

We stayed at Excalibur, which looks just like a castle.

The dinner show was called Tournament of Kings. There was singing, acting, real horses (and jousting on those horses!) as well as fireworks. We each got a whole game bird!

A group of us went off to a buffet for brunch at the Aria hotel.
