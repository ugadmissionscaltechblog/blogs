This term, my weekends are almost as busy and hectic as my weekdays. Despite the fact that I have 2 homework sets due on Mondays, I also have group meetings, dance classes and of course, can't forget the fun stuff!--it's the weekend after all.

I kicked off this past weekend by going out into Los Angeles to celebrate one of my friend's birthdays on Saturday. We went to a bunch of different places throughout the night, but my favorite was hanging out by the gorgeous pool at the luxury hotel, Viceroy in Santa Monica. All in all, it was nice to get dressed up and go out on the town with new and old friends.

I woke up early to go to ballet class and then went straight to a meeting for E/ME 105. At this meeting we discussed different design possibilities for the centrifuge. We all came with a few sketches with new ideas and concepts and just passed them around. We also had to plan out our separate roles for the midterm, which will comprise of a group paper and group presentation on the work we've done so far. I have been assigned to focus on the certain risk and failure analysis factors that could affect the success of the product. 
We had a few technical issues in the beginning as we set up skype to video conference with our Guatemala partners. But we ended up figuring it out (I mean, we're Techers after all!) and it was as if they were sitting right there with us during the meeting. We got a ton done in terms of figuring out different options for redesign--we definitely have our work cut out for us!

All the study rooms were taken in the Sherman Fairchild Library (that's where my E/ME 105 group meeting was) so we had to work in the basement of Dabney Library. That night was epic--stayed up till 4am to complete the econometrics set, and then ended up working the next day from noon till 5pm on the control theory set. But the good thing is having a fun study group that cracks jokes throughout the night and you can collaborate with.

Including an interview with a defense technology and homeland security company this afternoon!
Wish my luck!
