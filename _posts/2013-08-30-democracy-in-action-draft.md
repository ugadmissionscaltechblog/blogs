Today, Sandeep Pandey, a social activist, brought us to a small rural village and explained how the village governs itself. The village has one elected leader who is responsible for listening to the villager's needs. The village recieves a small amount of money from the government that the leader then spends on various projects like paving roads and installing electriity to houses. Here in the village, we could see the caste system much more manifested than in the city. While a city's organization prevents strict separation, the village allows for division by caste. Suprisingly, caste was a greater divider than religion in the village which was 65% Hindu and 35% Muslim. Lower caste members lived in separate sections of the village than upper caste members and cannot enter the homes of upper caste members or interdine with them.
