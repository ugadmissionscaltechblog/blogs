Last night was the Dress Rehearsal for the Dance Show. Though it ran smoothly, and we ended pretty early (went out to relax and grab boba at TeaSpots)---it was still pretty hectic backstage. We did some last minute staging for our formations and fixed details with lighting and sound.

I am dancing in four pieces this year...and it leaves me with very little time to change between numbers. I literally finish a piece....sprint backstage and do a quick change before running back onstage. So last night was the true test to see if I could make it all on time. I have to say though...it's gonna be a close one!
Today, I'll be resting up and preparing for the show tonight and tomorrow. I'm so excited! 
Here are a few pictures from last night's dress rehearsal...

Laying all my costume pieces out---lol you can see Paul in the background practicing so much...that he's a BLUR! hahaa
