Sorry I didn't post until now---I have been so busy with the show and resting after the show...I haven't gotten a chance to show all the wonderful pictures that were taken backstage and onstage Friday and Saturday night.

I have been dancing for so long, and my journey ends here at Caltech. I remember coming in as a freshman and being the only undergrad interested in dancing--it wasn't until my junior year when I finally met underclassman dancers. The program has really expanded since I came and I am sad to leave now. Just wanted to let my dance girlies know that I am so happy to have worked with you all and had so much fun.

I also want to thank all of my friends and family who came out to support me during this dance show and my previous ones. You guys are AWESOME!
