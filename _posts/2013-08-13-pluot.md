We got some pluots in our[ ](https://caltech.typepad.com/caltech_as_it_happens/2013/06/its-here.html)[farm box](https://www.typepad.com/services/trackback/6a0105349b8251970b01901db08645970b) the other day, which is super exciting because I've never had a pluot before. 
A photo of the food for the week; we got one of the [small-sized boxes](https://www.farmfreshtoyou.com/index.php) for this week because we had SPECIAL DINNER PLANS, so there's not that much food in it. 
What even is a pluot anyway? [Wikipeida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluot) tells me that it's some arbitrary mix of apricot and plums, but that doesn't tell me anything. I like both apricots and plums, so, at the very least, it shouldn't be terrible. 
Anyhow, here are some close-up shots of the pluot. The type of pluot we recieved is named Dapple Dandy or Dinosaur Eggs. Apparently, this type of pluot is called Dinosaur Eggs because it looks mottled and kind of ugly on the outside.

The pluot is crunchy. The texture is kind of like a hard, not-fully-ripe peach, but a lot jucier. The flesh is amazingly juicy and sugary, probably because it's in season. The skin adds a burst of sourness that complements the sugary flesh very well. All in all, the fruit tasted like... an arbitrary mix of apricot and plums. That doesn't tell you anything, does it... 
**Final Verdict: 10/10, it's called Dinosaur Eggs! How can you not like it? **
