From preseason until now, soccer has been a big part of my life here at Caltech. During preseason, we usually practiced twice a day, and when school started with the exception of games we trained from 4-6.But being on the soccer team isn't just about time spent on the field. Before a gamewe mentally prepare and watch what we eat, for the team. I've also made a lot of good friends with the soccer players.

<div id="yiv1614820121yui_3_7_2_15_1351326621022_39">We have our last game this Thursday then the season will be over.To be honest I'm pretty sad about it, and for many of the seniors on the team, this game will be the last they play.The tennis offseason training starts in a couple weeks, which will counter probably the absence of official soccer practice. I played competitive tennis in high school, so I'm eager to be picking up my racquets again.

<div id="yiv1614820121yui_3_7_2_15_1351326621022_39">Caltech is known for our excellent academic programs and not so much athletics. We have yet to win a game, which is not the position we wanted to be in.For some games, I think we've had the edge, but the other teams were able to come out with the win. Our team just has not yet been able to capitalize on enough opportunities. Sure, winning is better than losingbut as cheesy as it sounds I wouldn't trade the experience of being on the team for anything.Soccer is fun.

<div id="yiv1614820121yui_3_7_2_15_1351326621022_39">The chance to win a conference game this season is gone, but we still have one more opportunity. On Thursday we have a non-conference game; the only difference really is that this game doesn't count towards SCIAC rankings.One last game against SOKA, can we win?
