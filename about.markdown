This blog is written primarily for prospective or recently admitted students. Our goal is to tell great stories and to inform our readers about what life is like as a Caltech student. We have blog posts from 2009, some of the posts of which are not formatted correctly. The import process was quite hairy.

While reading, you may notice that our blog may not be as polished as other college blogs. I think that's kind of the point. Part of the charm is that this blog was built (mostly, except for the whole purchasing a theme part) and maintained by students. This site is run on the freely available Github Pages! While we have the choice to change the look and feel of the blog as we see fit, we also want feedback from our readers on what you'd like to read about.
