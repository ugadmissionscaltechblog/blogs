Hi fam!
Every term, the houses have formal dinner in place of a house dinner,so CDS provides us with food that's marginally better than usual, we all wear nice clothes, and try not to bang on tables or throw napkins for a nice dinner. Last Wednesday was Fleming's formal dinner, and it was a nice break from the sets.

The squad got dressed all snazzy-like, sat down like civilized people, and enjoyed each others' company. Not something we have a lot of time to do here at Tech, but much appreciated.

Cheers,
