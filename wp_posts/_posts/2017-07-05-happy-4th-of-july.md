Happy 4th of July everyone! This morning, I went to the San Jose Rose Garden to watch the Independence Day parade (my first 4th of July parade ever!). There were live singers, cheerleaders, old VW microbuses, and even Santa Claus in the parade.

There were all sorts of different roses!

A beautiful rose ðŸŒ¹

For lunch we went to a Cambodian restaurant called Chez Sovan in San Jose. It was amazing! My first time having Cambodian food around here -- if you're ever in the Bay, I would recommend getting the Amok, which is steamed curry fish wrapped in banana leaves.

When waiting for the fireworks, we had a picnic with sandwiches, hummus (!!), and lots of chips and popcorn. People were playing music, sports, and just hanging out while waiting.

Finally, at 9:30pm, the fireworks show started! It lasted for about 10 minutes, with special fireworks like hearts and smiley faces decorating the show. I especially love the golden fizzy fireworks. Happy Birthday America! ðŸŽ‰
