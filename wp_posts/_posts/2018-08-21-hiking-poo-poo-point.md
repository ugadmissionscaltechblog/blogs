Poo Poo Point is located to the east of Seattle. It's a relatively steep but short hike -- it's 3.8 miles roundtrip with an elevation gain of 1760 ft. This hike is accessible via public transportation using the Trailhead Direct shuttle, and it took about an hour and a half to get here from my apartment next to UW. It's really nice that these buses exist! It make it so much more convenient to go hiking :)

The forest around Seattle is so green, and there are so many different varieties of trees. It's quite different from California, which is much more yellow.

At the top, there's a great view of Lake Sammamish. We also saw some paragliders preparing to jump off the side of the mountain!
