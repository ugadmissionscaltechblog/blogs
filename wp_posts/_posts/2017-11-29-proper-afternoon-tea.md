The sponge cake is super sweet, but good. I think the filling is unique to the UK, but the texture of the cake is similar to some in America.

I didn't personally try the sandwiches and scone with clotted cream and jam, but they looked good!

We had a fun time, and I want to go to more afternoon teas! Although I think British sweets are a bit too sweet for me, I do like having tea, and it's a nice way to spend an afternoon.
