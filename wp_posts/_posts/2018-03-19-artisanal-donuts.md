In DTLA, there's a cute shop called Birdies LA that sells donuts! Instead of the typical flavors, they have dark chocolate, cinnamon toast crunch, strawberry and vanilla, and more. They even have a donut that is decorated like a penguin, and they were also featured on Buzzfeed for selling a $100 donut that's covered in gold flakes.

The donuts are more expensive than typical donuts -- the one I got, the dark chocolate donut, was $4.05 total. I thought it was really good, but I also love dark chocolate. I'm also not really a donut person, but this time since it was covered with dark chocolate (and it even had some gold flakes on it), it was nice :)
