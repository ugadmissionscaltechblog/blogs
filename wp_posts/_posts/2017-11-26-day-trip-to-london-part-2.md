After seeing a the skyline of London from afar, we headed into Westminster, home to the classic tourist attractions. To get there, we took the tube towards Buckingham Palace.

We then walked to the Big Ben and the London Eye. On the way, we crossed a bridge with a scenic, peaceful overlook. There were birds floating around and swimming on the water below, and we just watched them for a while :)

Unfortunately, the Big Ben was covered with scaffolding since it was under maintenance.

We grabbed dinner there before parting ways and heading back to Cambridge.
