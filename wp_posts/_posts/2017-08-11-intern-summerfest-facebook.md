Wednesday was another (yes, another) intern event. I am very grateful to the Facebook Recruiters that put so much work into holding these event and making our summer at Facebook really fun. This event was filled with cool things to do, from a huge inflatable obstacle course and carnival games, to caricatures and an arcade. My friends and I took full advantage of all of these things, all the while eating all the good provided food like kettle corn!

At the end of the festival, we got caricatures of ourselves (done by Marcus Sakoda, who thankfully made the drawings very flattering) and took a lot of pictures in front of the Facebook sign.
