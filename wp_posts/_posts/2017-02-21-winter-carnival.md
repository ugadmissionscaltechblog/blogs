This past Saturday, ASCIT (Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology) held a winter carnival event for both undergrads and graduate students! The goal of the event was to bring some winter fun to sunny So Cal and to provide stress relief during midterms. We had a similar event two years ago, but not last school year.

The event was held on campus from 2 pm - 8 pm, and consisted of an ice skating rink, fake snow, cookies, hot cider, hot chocolate, tea, and dinner (grilled hamburgers and hot dogs). A lot of students went to the event, if only for part of the time. The ice skating rink was interesting because it was not made of real ice, making it a different experience than traditional ice skating.
