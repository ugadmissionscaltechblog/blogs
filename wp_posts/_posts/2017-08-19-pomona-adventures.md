This weekend my boyfriend and I went on a trip to Pomona, which is about 30 minutes away from Caltech. We left with the intent of picking up an animal from someone on Craigslist, but ended up doing something a little bit different, and in my opinion, a little bit more fun!
We headed out fairly early (for Techers) on Saturday (11:30 AM) to avoid traffic. I know I ranted about this before, but in LA, a little bit of traffic can add quite literally hours to even a short trip. Trust me, it's worth the sacrifice in sleep to get an early start!
We ended up stopping at a drink shop, Zero X, this cute little coffee shop rated to have the best drinks in California. I ended up getting a strawberry horchata. Coming from New York, I never had horchata until I came to California, and I am in love. The creamy, cinnamon-y, rice-y drink hits the spot on hot summer days. The strawberry, though I did not think it would combine with cinnamon, only made the concoction even better. I also had some "milk and cereal": milk flavored ice cream with Special K cereal.

Once done, we walked across the street to take a picture with the Cal Poly sign. A lot of people who do not know Caltech get the two schools confused, and we thought it would be a funny joke to send our Techer friends the picture.

As we got to the local grocery store, I had a sinking sensation in my stomach. The person I was going to pick the pet up from was not responding to my texts or calls. We waited a while, Alex went inside to the grocery store, we looked at the passersby, nothing. Although reluctant and sad, Alex's foot hit the gas pedal and we drove away empty handed (don't always trust people on Craigslist!) Though the day did not end the way I wanted, I am so glad I got to get a taste of a new town. I also had the chance to spend the rest of the afternoon at the Pasadena Humane Society and SPCA, which you can hear more about in my next post!
