Although there are a lot of smaller things, such as midterm smoothies and milkshakes (Blacker does something similar to this) and some larger things like Faculty Dessert Night, the soc team usually agrees that beach trip is the most work.

This is because it’s an overnight trip, so the people organizing it need to organize sign-ups, drivers, the house we stay at, food for the people who go, and reimbursements (if there are any).As a driver to beach trip, I am able to get gas reimbursements - and a discount on the trip cost. Because I brought my own car, there was no need to rent one, but we often have more people going on the trip than can fit in cars that people are willing to bring. As such, rented cars are needed - but those drivers are also reimbursed for the cost of renting. It’s an astonishing amount of money that gets put into one of these trips, but I think that it’s really fun. I would say that the amount spent is worth it.

Our trip this year was down to Encinitas; soc team rented a duplex right on the beach, so there were gorgeous views of the ocean, especially as the sun was just setting over the waves. The colors lit up the sky in beautiful shades of pink and orange. I’m really glad that my car left early enough to get to see that view - although the time to leave was my decision anyway.
