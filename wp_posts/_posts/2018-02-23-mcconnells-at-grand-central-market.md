Grand Central Market in Downtown LA is great. It's home to many stalls selling food ranging from breakfast sandwiches like PB&amp;J to Thai food to lobster rolls to excellent ice cream. Since I went at night, more of the market type stalls were closed, but the ones selling dinner were still open.

GCM is also home to McConnell's, which has great ice cream. Their classic is the strawberries and cream flavor (Santa Barbara Strawberry). They also have homemade waffle cones for an extra $1. This time, we got the Santa Barbara Strawberry and Dark Chocolate Chips &amp; Bits -- absolutely delicious.
