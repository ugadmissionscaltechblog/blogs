Printed Matter recently hosted an LA Art Book Fair at the Geffen Contemporary at MOCA (Museum of Contemporary Art) in Little Tokyo. The fair focuses on the distribution of artists' books, and it is free to attend. Inside, there are hundreds of booths, each with its unique kind of merchandise, including books, zines, posters, monographs, and more.

Interestingly, the LA Festival of Books at USC was happening the same weekend! The Festival of Books focuses more on selling novels that aren't art-related, and the booths are typically from local bookstores. I went last year, but I didn't have the chance to go this time.

The Art Book fair lasted for 3 days and attracted thousands and thousands of people. There were all sorts of interesting books, from ones full of text to others that were purely photographs or drawings. It was fascinating to just browse through the material at each booth and talk to the artists. Below, I've included a couple images of the kind of merchandise we saw at each booth.

Afterwards, we went to a nearby boba shop called MILK+T, and they had cute Game of Thrones themed macarons! It was the opening night for Season 8 of Game of Thrones, so it was really apt timing.
