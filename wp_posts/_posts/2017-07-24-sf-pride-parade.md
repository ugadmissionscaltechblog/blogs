A few weeks ago I went to San Francisco's 46th annual Pride Parade! Starting at 10:30am, the parade lasted for about 4 hours. There was tons of support and excitement all around! Everyone dressed up for the parade, either in rainbow colors or in spectacular costumes. In the afternoon, there was a celebration at Civic Center with various street stalls, block parties, and live performances in the adjacent streets. I saw many families, people of various cultures and backgrounds, and cute corgis participating in the paradeðŸ˜Š
