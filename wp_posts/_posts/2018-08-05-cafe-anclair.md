In South Lake Union, there are tons of cafes, restaurants, and food trucks. One of the first places I visited was Cafe An'Clair. I found it on yelp and was attracted by the bulgogi sandwich and the cute pastries.

These are cute financier pastries I saw online :P Although I didn't buy one, I tried the sample, and it was really yummy! I eat too many desserts, which is why I didn't buy some for myself.

And here's the bulgogi sandwich :) I really liked it and would come back again! They also have a prosciutto sandwich that I'd be interested in trying.

I also got an orchid breve to go with my lunch. It was so unique I had to try it! I thought it was pretty yummy, although personally I like the lavender breves I've had before better (ahh the lavender vanilla breve at Jameson Brown next to Caltech is the best!!).
