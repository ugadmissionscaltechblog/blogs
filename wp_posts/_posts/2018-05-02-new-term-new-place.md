For the third term, a few friends and I decided to move off-off. This is the customary way for Techers to say renting an apartment not owned by Caltech, and therefore not governed by the Housing Contract. It’s an unusual move so late in the year, but our group knew that we wanted to move off-campus next year (for my Junior year). There’s a multitude of reasons to move so late, but our primary reason was that an apartment in our desired complex was up for rent, and so we wanted to take advantage of that while we had the chance.

Our first day of residence was the day before term started. I was stuck moving all of my stuff into the apartment that day, something that my flatmates made a lot of fun of. Especially since I seemed to have twice as many boxes as everyone else. It really did take the whole day to move, but it feels especially nice to have an apartment to call home (with our own kitchen!) with friends to call neighbors in the complex as well.

But even though we moved in, our living room is still pretty empty...
