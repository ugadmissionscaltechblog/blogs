Hi again,

So at the end of this week I went to get boba from Factory
Tea Bar, which is one of my favorite places for boba. If you haven’t had boba
before, it’s chewy, round, tapioca pearls that go in a drink and is delicious. London
had boba, but it was expensive, and LA definitely has better quality and wider
selection of drinks. We played Napoleon, a playing card game and hung out,
after a busy week. Going out for boba or late night food is common here,
especially to take a break after a long set. Caltech has more problem sets than
UCL, a difference in teaching styles. At UCL, I was expected to study and work more
independently, although there were tutorials (which are similar to our
recitations). At Caltech, there is a stronger sense of collaboration, which is
emphasized by difficult sets from time to time. This collaboration is important
and prepares us with the mindset and skills to tackle real life problems,
especially after we graduate. I believe such collaboration helps advance
research and science, fostering teamwork as well. Don’t get me wrong-I
definitely enjoyed the change of pace at UCL, but it’s nice to be back in the swing
of things here and I’m enjoying my classes this term.
