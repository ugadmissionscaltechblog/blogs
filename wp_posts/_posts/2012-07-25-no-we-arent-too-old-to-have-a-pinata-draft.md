Last weekend we celebrated Nadia's 22nd birthday. The festivities included delicious homemade[flautas](https://www.google.com/search?q=flautas&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;prmd=imvnse&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=-mgQUN79Momc9gTG1YCgCQ&amp;ved=0CH8QsAQ&amp;biw=1198&amp;bih=754)and cake, a Batman pinata, and a game called Mexican Train Dominos.

I wanted to get Nadia a present, and since she just moved into a new apartment and doesn't have many appliances/kitchen items, I thought a tea kettle, tea bags, and hot cocoa mix would be appreciated. I will probably use it myself when I'm over there...

Here are some pictures from the night!

Sadly, I didn't get a picture of the Mexican Train Dominoes. But trust me - it's a fun game. If you get a chance to play, I'd recommend it!

All in all, a very fun night :)
