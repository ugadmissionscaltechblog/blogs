For those who don't know, Ditch Day is an annual campus-wide tradition. The seniors plan it for all of the underclassmen (juniors included), and nobody except for the seniors knows when it is until the day of. On Ditch Day, the seniors will run around the houses waking everybody up at 8 am. All classes are cancelled and no homework is due! Underclassmen sign up for "stacks" which are collections of fun puzzles and activities centered around a theme. Houses generally have at least two stacks, so underclassmen can choose their stack. The stack lasts for the whole day.

Since I'm a senior, I planned a stack with several of my senior friends. Our stack's theme was The Fast and The Furious. Our activities included surfboard relay racing in the Gene Pool, life sized Rush Hour (a puzzle game), and a remote controlled car relay race in one of the parking lot basements. We also took everyone to Speedzone for four hours of unlimited go karting, arcade games, and a round of mini golf. Afterwards, we went out to dinner together. Some cars went to In-N-Out and others went to Curry House.

After participating in stacks since my freshman year, it was definitely cool being on the other side of things and seeing our hard work pay off when the underclassmen were having fun.

Page has a tradition of painting doors for each stack for Ditch Day!
