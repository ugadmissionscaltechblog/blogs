Hey fam,
This weekend was ASCIT Formal, which is kind of like prom, expect it’s college, your mom’s not forcing you to buy a corsage, and the pictures are far less awkward. (ASCIT stands for Associated Students of the California Institute of Technology.)
Our venue was absolutely gorgeous. We had a photo booth, and dinner, and a really sweet lounge that overlooked Old Pasadena.

And of course we danced.

A lot.

It’s always fun to see everybody out of the usual sweats and messy buns. And with formal being only a week after term, the work hasn’t piled up yet, and we can all afford to take a break.

Turns out Caltech students clean up nice.
