Excursion #3: Walking Around Alhambra

A short drive away from campus is downtown Alhambra. Besides plenty of food options, it has one of the closest theaters.

Bon Appetea offers boba, macarons, kale salads and also deep fried Chinese snacks. It is the setting of a Youtube short by Wong Fu Productions, "How Old Is She?!" that has garnered over 4 million views since it published in 2015.

The line at Boiling Crab is always long, but it is worth the wait for plastic baggies full of flavorful crayfish, shrimp and other seafood. The food is dumped out in front of you on the table, where you can go at it with your bare hands.

Cheap eats don't have to be shabby. Big Catch Seafood House, a sister restaurant to the nearby EMC Seafood, has $1 oysters during Happy Hour. Its regular menu features upscale dishes such as uni pasta, bone marrow, and a seafood tower with a 3 digit price tag.

Gen Korean BBQ is arguably one of the best Korean BBQ places nearby. Most people go for the All-You-Can-Eat option. Diners grill their own meat and eat it with traditional accompaniments like kimchi, rice wrappers, and assorted side dishes.
