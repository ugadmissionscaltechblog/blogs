I am back in San Diego for winter break--three weeks of relaxing and celebrating the holidays! But don't worry---I will continue to blog...

I was at JPL for half a day on Tuesday and then hurried to LA to catch the Amtrak to get home for my sister's concert. I ALMOST missed the train home...since there was some unexpected delay I had with the Gold Line (the Metro going from Pasadena to LA) and picking up my ticket at the train station. I was SOO stressed out...since the next train out to San Diego was two hours later and I would have been late to the concert....but it's OK cause I was able to get onto the train at the last minute.

I have been taking the train between LA and SD since my sophomore year. It's so convenient and such an enjoyable ride (esp during the day when you can see the coast for half of the ride). It takes about 2 hours and only costs me about $20 one way. I have also signed up for the rewards program---so every 4-5 trips one way trips or so...I get free!
I conked out on half of the train ride since I was so tired (and have been fighting a cold/sore throat since the weekend)..but woke up just in time to see the surf.
