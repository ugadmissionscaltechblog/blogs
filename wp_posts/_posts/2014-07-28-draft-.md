I think it's safe to say most of us spend the majority of our time indoors. Most of us sleep and eat indoors, anyway. Working indoors just seals the deal for me. I like to do something outside at least once a day. Taking a stroll or going for a bike ride (definitely using the inclusive "or" here) helps keep my legs from cramping up and gives me a good appetite for the batch of zucchini bread I made with a friend last night.

On Saturday, the same zucchini-bread-making friend and I took a short bike right to Victory Park, which is northeast of campus. There was a beautiful view of the mountain.

There, we played frisbee and ate homemade sandwiches. I'm a peanut butter and jelly person. Also, I ate Pringles for the first time in at least 6 years, probably more.

It was really pleasant to spend time away from electronics (other than snapping a picture of the view with my phone camera for blogging purposes) and campus.

On Sunday, I woke up and learned a new skill before breakfast! I practiced making poached eggs for the first time. There are easy instructions [here](https://www.esquire.com/features/cook-eggs-0509). Out of the 6 eggs I cracked, 5 of them turned out as fully fledged poached eggs. They tasted great on whole wheat toast with some salt and pepper. I can also vouch for the success of cinnamon sugar on eggs.

I also took Sunday to catch up on my life. I did laundry before I had run out of socks, I patched some tears in some of my favorite shorts, and I ate saltines with strawberry jam. All of these are very important to my life balance.
