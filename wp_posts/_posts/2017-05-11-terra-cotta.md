This is a review of [Terra Cotta](https://www.yelp.com/biz/terra-cotta-los-angeles-3) in Koreatown. I went to Terra Cotta for my birthday dinner with my boyfriend on a Sunday night. They didn't have uni (sea urchin) or toro (fatty tuna) when I went because it was a Sunday and the seafood wouldn't be fresh since it was a Sunday. I assume the seafood markets selling uni and toro didn't have them that Sunday (or maybe they usually don't carry them on Sundays). Anyway, I would recommend going on a different day because I definitely wanted to try the uni dishes and you get more for your money on other days (you pay the same for the dishes that contain uni on Sundays).
