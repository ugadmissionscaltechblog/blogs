It's common for the new seniors (who are technically juniors) to set up a fake Ditch Day stack after the real Ditch Day. For Page House, our "Day After" fake stack happened a week after. At 8 am, the house was woken up to a battle between Twix bunny and the Frosted Flakes tiger.

We had some cereal themed puzzles.

We also had to go around the house looking for our adorably helpless stuffed animal mascots.
