I'm back in Houston after spending a fun and relaxing week in Maryland and Virginia Beach. :)
On my first day there, I celebrated my cousin's graduation at this huge party with relatives and friends. The night was filled with dining, dancing and catching up with family.

Later that night, my newly graduated cousin took my cousins and me out to a lounge in Baltimore to celebrate at an after party with his college friends--and then to a late night diner for some munchies!
After a few days in Maryland, a whole lot of us drove 4 hours to have some R&amp;R in Virginia Beach. For 3 days, my cousins, aunts, uncles and I spent time on the beach and explored the VB pier.

I'll be celebrating the 4th of July with some new friends at a Crawfish Boil/BBQ pool party. Hope y'all enjoy your holiday!
