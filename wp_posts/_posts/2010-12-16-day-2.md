We heard from Cynthia Robinson, the director for the Science and Technology Policy Fellowships and a fellow that graduated from Caltech. The fellow went onto a postdoc after her Ph.D., but realized that she wanted to try something a bit different. She's a biochemist, but with her fellowship, she working with an organization that deals with agriculture. We had a lively group that asked many questions, so the session was very interesting.
