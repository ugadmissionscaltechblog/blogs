This weekend we (myself and my friends also here at Caltech for study abroad) visited both Versailles and had the first of many days' visits to Paris. Both have a long history of kings who have lived there, and while we got to see a lot of what Versailles had to offer, we are nowhere near done with Paris.

We walked around inside a bit and caught a sight of some of the royal bedrooms and hallways
