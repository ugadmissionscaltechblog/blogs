Hey everyone!
I am Pratheek, and I am from South Florida. I flew into Caltech today for PFW and I was excited to seem some familiar faces as well as all the other prefrosh. The campus looks beautiful, and it's very small and homely. I got to listen in some of the departmental roundtables such as the Physics and Computer Science ones. I enjoyed speaking with some of the current students as well as the faculty! I look forward to seeing what tomorrow has in store!
