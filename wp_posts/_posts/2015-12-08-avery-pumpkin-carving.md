Last Friday, Avery had an alley pumpkin carving challenge at Tom Mannion's house. There were two pumpkins per alley, and plenty of snacks to go around - pie, corn dogs, bagel bites, donuts, and even warm apple cider (yummm!).

My alley, Alley 1, carved a Charlie Brown pumpkin and Joker pumpkin. Both of them required a lot of precision, and I think they turned out really well!

*Why so serious?*

And here's some pictures of the incredibly creative designs everyone else had!

*Kitty, Pac-Man, and the Morton Salt girl.*

*Minion, Homura (an anime character), and Kitty, again.*

*Jesus, Tim (a kid in Avery), and doge.*

*The winner: two wolves howling. (Sorry for bad picture!)*

Pumpkin carving was definitely a welcome break from midterms. I can't wait to see what everyone thinks of next year!
