On Valentine's Day, my boyfriend and I started off the day by making scrambled eggs on toast. I love toast and almost every variation on toast! I feel pretty silly saying that, but it's true.

In the afternoon, we went to The Grove, which is an outdoor shopping area in LA. It's a really nice place to just walk around, since there's a fountain in the middle and a lot of small food shops in the 'Farmers Market' area. 
When we were there, we went to World Market and bought stroopwafels and dark chocolate cookies called Digestives!! I didn't know I could find Digestives in the US; before I left Cambridge, I was planning on buying a pack to bring home, but the grocery store closed at 5pm that day, so I was too late ): . In the UK, these biscuits are commonly eaten with tea and are found everywhere in grocery stores for 2 pounds for 20 cookies.

The next day, which was my birthday, I made dark chocolate chip and m&amp;m cookies and dark chocolate covered strawberries with my boyfriend! Cookies and strawberries are always yummy, so it was fun and a cute time :)
