So, what exactly does it take to get through 3 (almost 4!) years of Tech?

*1. Friends (taken at Lloyd's Casino Night, 2010).*

I could break it down even more (such as: dancing to your favorite song at 2am, late-night food runs, professors who are always willing and excited to hear about your future, jumping into the ocean, wearing a frilly sundress mid-winter, the beautiful sunny weather!!. . . ), but the point is:
Tech is more rigorous than anything you will have ever encountered before, but your experience here will last a lifetime. Enjoy it, and don't let being occasionallyoften swamped in work ruin the fact that this is a truly unique and amazing place to call home.
