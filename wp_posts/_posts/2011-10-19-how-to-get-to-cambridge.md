Everybody says that Cambridge is like Hogwarts, but the similarities were apparent even before I arrived. If you've read the Harry Potter stories, you pretty much know how to get to Cambridge too! If you don't, follow these simple instructions:
1. Go to London's** King's Cross Station**. It will look something like this:

2. Find **Platform 9 and 3/4**. There were some renovations going on for London 2012, so they relocated the platform from its usual spot.

3. Buy tickets to the **Cambridge Express**. Yes, my train was called the Cambridge Express (kinda sounds like Hogwarts Express right?). There are trains that run from King's Cross station to Cambridge every hour, but every few hours, they would run a train directly to Cambridge without any stops. Those appeared on the "Departure" screen as "Cambridge Express."

4. Sit back and enjoy the beautiful **English countryside**... there are lots of sheep and cows.
