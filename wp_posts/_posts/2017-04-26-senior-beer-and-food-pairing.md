Note: Only students of legal drinking age were allowed to attend this event.

Tom Mannion is the Director of Student Affairs at Caltech. Part of his job includes planning fun events for students and keeping students happy. Other events he hosts at his house (across from the Undergraduate Admissions Office) have included a Super Bowl Party, Be a Kid Again Day, video game tournaments, and more!

Each year, each class gets a "tasting" event at Tom's house. For example, as a freshman I went to a chocolate tasting event. The juniors this year had a tea and food pairing event. Seniors in the past had a wine and food pairing event. This time, Tom wanted to try out a beer and food pairing for the seniors. It was so much fun and the food was amazing! I'm not a huge beer fan, but it was definitely cool to see and try so many different types.
