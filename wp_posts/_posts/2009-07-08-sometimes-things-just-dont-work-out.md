You might have guessed from the title of my post that I don't have very good news. I told you last time how I've picked 3000 colonies. After the colonies got a chance to grow in media, the released enzymes in the supernatant were suspended in solution with our substrate. You might remember (or even if you don't, I'll recap) that when I was looking for the best mutation rate, I had 400 mutants, 100 each representing a different mutant. I had done a sugar assay to determine which mutation rate that I wanted. I kind of skimmed over that process, but I'll go into more detail now.
