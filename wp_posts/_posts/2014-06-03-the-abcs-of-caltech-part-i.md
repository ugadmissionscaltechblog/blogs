Caltech has a beautiful campus, and equally beautiful students, and since I'm graduating soon, I wanted to share both with you in a perhaps unconventional way. Thus began my Caltech Alphabet project. For the past few weeks, my friends and I have been brainstorming various buildings and locations on campus that correspond to each letter of the alphabet. Some letters (especially B,R, and X!) were difficult to create using the human form, but I think the results are not too shabby.. Enjoy!

Stay tuned for more glimpses of the campus and students! If you've visited Caltech and have a favorite building you'd like to see here, feel free to comment below!
That's all for now,
