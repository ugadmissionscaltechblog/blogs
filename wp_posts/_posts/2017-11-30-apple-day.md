The Cambridge University Botanical Garden hosted an Apple Day a few weekends ago. It was a huge festival featuring apple tasting, apple juices and ciders, food trucks, other small wares, and more. For a 3 pound entry, we got to taste probably 30 different varieties of apples and get free samples of juices and ciders. I didn't know so many different types of apples even existed! Some apples tasted more nutty, some had strawberry hints, some tasted like plums...there were so many different types.

I'd also never been in the Botanical Garden before, so it was cool to check out the garden. However, most of the plants weren't flowering since it's near winter.

The line for apple tasting was crazy! It probably took us 20 minutes to get through the line, but it was definitely worth it. All of the apples had their own names and descriptions; it was really fun and interesting to read all of them, taste them, and marvel that they were actually very accurate. The photo I have below doesn't have an exciting description, but some examples were 'foreign' (like from outer space, the apple's name was something like Jupiter), 'nutty', or 'will not disappoint' and others like those.
