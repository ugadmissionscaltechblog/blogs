Every Spring, there's international week where every day, there's a different internationally-themed event. On one of the days, there's a food fair, where students set up booths to serve food from their home country. It costs $5 to get a plate, but afterwards, you can line up for as many different stalls as you want, as many times as you want, for food.

There was also a stage where people from different groups were performing. The group in the photo is Dhamaka, Caltech's largest Indian dance group!

In 3rd term, Page hosts a cocktail party for its members. There are hors d'oeuvres, live music, games (poker, trivia, and newlyweds), a photobooth, and of course, cocktails for the 21+ students.Sorry the photo is really dark, but this is the stage, where people were playing jazzy music.
