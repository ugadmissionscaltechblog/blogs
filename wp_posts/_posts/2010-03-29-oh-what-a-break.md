****I can't believe I just am wrapping up my LAST spring break as a Techer!It feels like yesterday that I was coming home for my first spring break three years ago, after just finishing up pass/fail and preparing to begin a life on grades. Well, let's just say it really sets in the fact that you have to enjoy each and every day cause it goes by so quickly!
Anyway, enough musing and philosophizing - let me tell you what I did on my Spring Vacation (like those middle school projects you used to do but the spring edition). So it started off, as Dannah said, with her visit to my quaint part of NJ. We had a packed itinerary, going to Atlantic City (to eat some good food and try our luck on the slots), New York City (to eat some good food and go see a show), Sunday Dinner (prepared by my mother, for some GREAT food), and then around to "where I grew up." Do you see the common denominator in all those activities?? All in all, a fun (and filling!) trip for her.

I made a trip (again!) to New York, this time to meet up with Lisa, my neighbor in Fleming House (and her friend Gazal), to eat some Korean food and stroll around the city.

She's majoring in English (what?! you can MAJOR in that!?) and doing her master's at Oxford. Sounds pretty impressive! Unfortunately, we had a bit of a winter relapse so we were a bit chilly.

![](/old_images/caltech_as_it_happens/6a0105349b8251970b01310ff00bb6970c.jpg)Well, I think that's pretty much what I did over this break (just maybe throw in a couple more family meals and such). Now that I've successfully eaten my way through NJ (and NY, too!), it's time to go back to school and begin the FINAL term!
Oh, and don't worry - I'll be posting a med school decision update soon :).
