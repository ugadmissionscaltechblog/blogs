Today we went to check out Nancy Silverton's other restaurant, Pizzeria Mozza. Osteria Mozza completely wowed us and we decided to try the other part of the Mozzaplex. Pizzeria and Osteria are right next to each other and the staff rotate between the two restaurants. Pizzeria is a lot more affordable than the Osteria and is perhaps the most affordable restaurant from Chef's Table.


We went smack in the middle of lunch time were lucky to snag some seats by the pizza bar. For me, these are the optimal seats in the house since you can see all the pizzas being made from scratch. The gentlemen making the pizzas are machines. They shape the dough, lay on the toppings and man the ovens non stop. It makes the experience extra special to know that everything is made from scratch and the ingredients are super fresh.




We got three pizzas: Squash blossom with burrata, Meat lover's (guanciale, sausage and pepperoni), and pizzette (with leeks, fontina, egg and 'Nduja). These pizzas have non traditional toppings with a non traditional dough, but they were DELICIOUS. It was the crispiest and most complex crust I've ever had. Also, I don't know who came up with the idea of eating flowers, but I love him/her because the squash blossoms were LIFE CHANGING. They brush a layer of olive oil on the crust which gives it a beautiful color. They also finish the pizzas with a drizzle of olive oil which makes them extra decadent. Definitely THE BEST PIZZA IN LA!!!

We couldn't forgo dessert since Nancy Silverton is a famous pastry chef. Her most well-known and influential dessert is the Butterscotch Budino with Rosemary Cookies. It's so famous that the recipe is pasted on the wall by their restrooms. It was the most delicious and sophisticated version of butterscotch that I have ever tasted.

Mozzaplex, I love you. I will be back soon. Next on the restaurant bucket list is N/naka, but I have to reserve months in advance. I trust Chef's Table's recommendations.
