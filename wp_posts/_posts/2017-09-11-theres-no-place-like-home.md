Upon landing, I got to see my family waiting for me outside the terminal. It was quite a touching sight, especially when my little sister rushed to hug me, and my older brother also joined in (*gasp*). My parents welcomed me home as well (they reserved their own hugs), before we all rushed off to my grandmotherâ€™s house.

We spent our weekend there, catching up with family and seeing my aunts and uncles again. Although not all of my extended family could make it, I enjoyed seeing whomever I could, and we had a nice Sunday dinner with everyone. Before leaving, I made sure to give my grandmother my newest crochet creation, which was an owl I made over my internship in my free time. She really loved it, and it joined the kitten I made when I first picked up crochet during winter break.
