Ouch! My back hurts from a whole lot of jumping this morning!
I woke up early this morning to meet a photographer over at Millikan Pond to take dance action shots of me. Most of the shots were of me jumping in the air....and I was not sore...until 2 hours later.

I was approached by Dr. Carol Carmichael (First Lady of Caltech!) a few weeks ago and was asked if I would be interested in taking a senior portrait that would hang in the President's House. Since she and President Chameau came to Caltech in 2006 (the same year I came in), they have had about 4-5 seniors from every graduating class take black and white portraits to hang in their home to commemorate and represent the class. It was such an honor---and of course I obliged. 
Even though all of the real portraits have yet to be uploaded--I have a few behind the scenes shots by my amateur spontaneous photographer/good friend, Andrew. :) I got to see some of the shots taken by the photographer, Louis Felix, and I was super surprised to see how well they turned out...can't wait to see all shots...and which one President Chameau and Dr. Carmichael choose to put up. 
Louis and I discussing the composition of the shots and the possible locations...

Setting up the lights at this location...

![](/old_images/caltech_as_it_happens/6a0105349b8251970b013480974603970c.jpg)It's hard coming up with new jumps that will translate well in photographs...I seemed to almost always default to this one...


![](/old_images/caltech_as_it_happens/6a0105349b8251970b0133ed63b3a1970b.jpg) Louis was awesome to work with and really gave me good direction
