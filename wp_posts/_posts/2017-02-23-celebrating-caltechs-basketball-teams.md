Excursion #1: Celebrating Caltech'sBasketball Teams
Let's go to the ball game! There are few places that highlight Caltech's school pride as much as our basketball games. Tonight was doubly special: it's Senior Night as well as Orange Out. Senior Night celebrates all the seniors on the team. The Student-Athlete Advisory Committee organizes one Orange Out event for each of the sports teams and provides entertainment, free goodies, and food. The women's volleyball team volunteered at the event, handing out free pizza, orange T-shirts, frisbees, and more.

The women's team celebrated their lone senior Kate Lewis - Caltech's [#2 top scorer and #2 rebounder](https://twitter.com/caltechwbb/status/833469856225882113) in all time. They took home a sweeping win of 76-44.

The men's team's seniors - Ricky Galliani, Nasser Al-Rayes, and David LeBaron - won Caltech's very first game against a regionally ranked opponent tonight with a close score of 61-59. These 3 players will graduate having won the most basketball conference wins under their belt than other other player in our school's history. In fact, shortly after this game, Nasser was named [SCIAC Athlete of the Week](https://www.thesciac.org/aotw/2016-17/Week_24-_feb_20/Weeklies/MBB_2.20.17.pdf) for the 2nd time this year.
