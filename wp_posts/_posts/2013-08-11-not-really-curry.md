Roommate N found some free canned beans lying around, which obviously meant that dinner that night was beans. I don't remember what sorts of beans they are; all I knew was that they're not your reguler old black beans or pinto beans or kidney beans. Anyway, Roommate N wanted to make Indian-style curry, and so we did. 
We didn't have a recipe for Indian-style curry things, so Friend N just went by the "probably legit" way of cooking. We first stir-fried the beans with some string beans, then added a large number of spices and herbs that's lying around the kitchens/we bought some long time ago. Some things added include: yogurt, cinnamon, curry powder, cumin, and crushed cashews. I think this dish has the greatest number of ingredients we've put into anything we made so far...!
Here's a photo of a stash of some of the things we used: 
The finished dish:

The dish ended up tasting... not very Indian curry-like. I think we 
didn't add enough spices or something, because the yogurt's taste is quite overwhelming. We have a tendency to underspice 
things because we're afraid of over spicing, but now the combination of spice in this dish just kinda tastes... weird. Not sure how we could've fixed it. 
**Protip: Use a recipe if you're making something complicated. **
Oh well, the dish was still edible though. ****
**Final verdict: acquired taste/10**
