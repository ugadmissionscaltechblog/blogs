As a prospective (or even current) Caltech student, you may be wondering, ‘What is there to do around campus?’ Well, fortunately, Pasadena and the Greater LA area is filled with things to do and places to see!

If you or a friend has a car, then great! But Caltech also offers all students a free metro pass that is valid for unlimited rides on all Metro bus and rail lines, as well as many local bus systems including Pasadena Transit.

I was fortunate enough to be able to move to Pasadena during the third term of my freshman year, even though school was virtual. So I have been in Pasadena for about a year and half now. This list includes many of the places I have visited from March 2021 to July 2022.

**Mountains**

_Griffith Observatory (\~15 miles)_

Griffith gives a great view of the Hollywood sign and LA, while the observatory has many exhibits which are free of charge for visitors. There are also a number of hiking trails in Griffith Park. Last time my friends and I went, we followed the East Observatory Trail from Griffith Observatory all the way out of the park, and we ended up walking all the way to the Hollywood Walk of Fame!

_Angeles Crest Highway (\~15 miles)_

This highway snakes around the San Gabriel Mountains, and has plenty of great lookout points to pull over and watch the sunset. The lookout that I stopped at was 701 Angeles Crest Highway.

**Beaches**

_Malibu (\~55 miles)_

Malibu is a great destination for a day trip! My friends and I spent the afternoon relaxing on Trancas Beach with a picnic. Later in the day, we drove around the area and ended up at a lookout on Encinal Canyon Road, where we watched the sunset.

_Manhattan (\~30 miles)_

Manhattan Beach is one of the closest beaches to Caltech, if you’re looking for something nearby! I’ve visited this beach on countless occasions. This beach is right next to Hermosa Beach, another one of my favorites.

_Huntington (\~50 miles)_

Huntington Beach is another popular beach for Caltech students, and is a long stretch of beach with lots of fire pits. It’s a great option if you are looking to start a fire and make some s’mores!

**Piers**

_Santa Monica Pier (\~25 miles)_

This spot has all the things you would expect of a pier, from little vendor carts and restaurants to a ferris wheel. There is also a pretty nice beach on the side of the pier. But be warned – the pier is a pretty popular tourist spot and is almost always busy. But it’s a great place to bring visiting friends and family!

_Hermosa Beach Pier (\~32 miles)_

Hermosa Beach Pier is one of my favorite SoCal spots. This spot is home to a short stretch of shops, restaurants and bars, and the pier extends about 1000 ft into the ocean. If you want to enjoy a quiet night of watching the waves crash into the shore, Hermosa is a great spot. Also if you are a fan of musicals, La La Land’s the Lighthouse Cafe is actually located at the pier, and the scene from ‘City of Stars’ where Ryan Gosling is walking up the pier is also at this pier.

**LA**

_Hollywood (\~17 miles)_

Hollywood is another popular tourist spot on this list, but I figured that I couldn’t live in SoCal for four years, and not see Hollywood. On this trip, I walked the Hollywood Walk of Fame and saw the Chinese Theater and the Capitol Records Building. But there is lots more to do and see in Hollywood, if you’re interested.

_Rodeo Drive (\~25 miles)_

Another SoCal classic, Rodeo Drive is home to pretty much every designer store you can think of! I enjoyed an afternoon of window shopping and getting a feel for the LA crowd.

**Museums**

_LACMA (\~18 miles)_

The LA County Museum of Art is a great museum to visit again and again. I took my first visit last year in August, where a friend and I toured most of the museum, but spent a lot of time in one of the rotating exhibits, which at the time showcased Yoshitomo Nara’s collection. I thought it was a youthful and fun exhibit, even as someone who does not have much of a background in art. I hope to visit again soon to see a new exhibit featuring fashion legend, Lee Alexander McQueen.

Adult Tickets to LACMA are $20, but there is a student discount, putting the tickets at $16 per visit.

_Academy Museum of Motion Pictures (\~18 miles)_

The Academy Museum is located right next to LACMA, and just opened last year. This museum provided really interesting insight into the process of making movies, and the history of motion pictures, along with housing some really cool movie props, and a room full of oscars! My favorite part of this museum was seeing early sketches and models of my favorite animated characters, like Bing Bong from ‘Inside Out’.

Adult Tickets to the Academy Museum are $25, but the rate for students is only $15!

**The Rose Bowl**

_Flea Market (\~4 miles)_

Just four miles from campus, the Rose Bowl hosts many events throughout the year that are popular among Caltech students. One of their events is the Rose Bowl Flea Market, which happens on the second Sunday of every month, and is a great spot for buying things like jewelry, plants, and second hand clothes, along with hand crafted goods.

_Foodieland (\~4 miles)_

The Rose Bowl also hosts the FoodieLand Night Market, which features lots of popular restaurants and trendy foods. If you want to try lots of different foods in one place, don’t miss this event. I would recommend going with a big group of friends so you can share and try lots of different things. Entry was around $5 the last time that I went, but the food can be on the pricier side.

**Theme Parks**

_Disneyland Park (\~40 miles)_

There are a couple different theme/amusement parks in the LA area, but so far, the only one I have been to is Disneyland Park. As someone who was not too into Disney as a child, I have to say that I had the best time. I enjoyed all of the rides, and watched the end of the day fireworks and Fantasmic. Overall, I thought it was definitely worth making the trip out to Anaheim.
