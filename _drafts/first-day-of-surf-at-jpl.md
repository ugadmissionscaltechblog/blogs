title: First day of SURF at JPL

I started my first day at JPL as part of the SURF program last Tuesday. I didn’t know what to expect on the first day, as most upperclassmen who had interned at JPL had done so remotely because of the pandemic. Over the traditional 10-week period of SURF, Caltech provides a free shuttle from the Caltech campus to JPL in the morning at 7:30 and 8:15am and in the evening at 5:15 and 6:00pm.

Once we arrived, we had a swift orientation in the Von Karman Auditorium where we were informed of the appointments that we would have for badging and IT provisioning, the history of JPL, who to reach in case of emergency, the online training that we have to complete, and the overall organization of departments. I then met with my mentor who showed me his office, detailed the aspects of the project that I would be working on, and introduced me to some members of the team as part of the group 383 in the Optics Department.

JPL’s campus, often referred to as “the lab,” has many different buildings with numbers corresponding to the order in which they were built (with some exceptions). My mentor gave me a tour of some highlights of the campus including the mission control room, the Mars yard, the Spacecraft Assembly Facility, as well as rover replicas in the Visitor Center.

After presenting all identity documents necessary at the badging office for my appointment, we met with a Caltech graduate working as a software engineer on the project to grab lunch in one of the main cafeterias on campus. There was a good diversity of food, similar to Browne on Caltech campus.

After further discussing the goals and different aspects of the project that I will be working on for the next 10 weeks, it was time for me to grab the shuttle back to Caltech near the “mall,” the main outdoor space of the campus. I really enjoyed my first day at JPL and did not expect the campus to be so big. JPL benefits from awesome views of the mountains being located on a hill. They have regular shuttles to help employees get from one end of campus to the other as there are a lot of inclines. It was also nice to see that there are lots of social events for employees and that the work environment remains casual both through interactions as part of teams and through the attire requirements.
