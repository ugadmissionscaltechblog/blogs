**â€¦How a Disciple of Bethany Ehlmann, a Former Desert Militiaman, two Moore Subbasement Dwellers, an Anti-Arson Activist, Roblox's Newest Intern, and a Luminous Plasma Scientist Went to War with the Caltech Mail Center, Survived Three COVID Outbreaks, Played E-mail Tag with ASCIT, and Nearly Stranded Themselves in the Mojave in order to Send a Bag of Peanuts to Space (A True Story).**

_The sun is hot. The air is bone-dry. Frankly, it's amazing that we've made it this far into the middle of nowhere, and it's going to be even more amazing if we manage to make it back out._

_In hindsight, it probably shouldn't have taken a flat tire for us to realize that what Google Maps called "Transmission Line Road" was very much not a road at all. We've come so far, now only 2.5 miles from the (alleged) landing site after a wild goose chase across half of Southern California..._

Before we get to all that, I'm afraid we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Michael Gutierrez ("Guutz"), a first-year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. (It's also my first blog post -- hello!)

I had the opportunity to embark on this adventure through the Caltech [**CubeSat Club**](https://smallsats.caltech.edu/). \[In a sentence: CubeSat = cheap, bread-loaf-sized satellite that you* can build and [**yeet into Earth orbit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQy9EwMrILI&ab_channel=Nanoracks)\] The website makes it sound really impressive, but the missing context is that all of its pre-pandemic members had either graduated or left by the end of last year. This left five sophomores and one freshperson(?) to scrounge together the remnants, scattered everywhere from an almost-forgotten Google Drive to a room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the [**Space Structures Lab**](http://www.pellegrino.caltech.edu/). 

Our original plan was to submit a proposal for [**NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative**](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative), but it was quickly realized that we lacked the knowledge and experience (and staffing) to design a spacecraft mission in time for the November deadline. 

But that wasn't going to stop us! We were going to build a CubeSat, darn it. Even if it ended up being less of a cube-shaped satellite and more of a rectangular prism-shaped science box... and if NASA wasn't going to take us to space, we were going to have to get there ourselves.
