**…Or, How a Disciple of Bethany Ehlmann, a Former Desert Militiaman, Moore Lab Subbasement Dwellers, Roblox's Newest Intern, a Florida Man, and a Luminous Plasma Scientist Went to War with the Caltech Mail Center, Got Double-Crossed by AirGas Corp., Survived Three COVID Outbreaks, and Nearly Stranded Themselves in the Mojave in order to Send a Bag of Peanuts to Space (A True Story).**

_The sun is hot. The air is bone-dry. Frankly, it's amazing that we've made it this far into the middle of nowhere, and it's going to be even more amazing if we manage to make it back out._

_In hindsight, it probably shouldn't have taken a flat tire for us to realize that what Google Maps called "Transmission Line Road" was very much not a road at all. We've come so far, now only 2.5 miles from the (alleged) landing site after a wild goose chase across half of Southern California..._

Before we get to all that, I'm afraid we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Michael Gutierrez ("Guutz"), a first-year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. (It's also my first blog post -- hello!)

This adventure began last fall, when I joined Caltech's [**CubeSat Club**](https://smallsats.caltech.edu/).

> **cube·sat** ║ kjub sæt ║ (n.) **1.** A tiny, inexpensive satellite, about the size of a loaf of bread, that can [**hitch a ride into Earth orbit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQy9EwMrILI&ab_channel=Nanoracks) using empty space in another rocket.

The Caltech website plays us up _a lot_, but the missing context is that all of the club's pre-pandemic members had either graduated or left by the end of last year. This left five sophomores plus one "me", led by our intrepid president Turner Bumbary (AKA the Luminous Plasma Scientist), to scavenge through the remnants scattered everywhere from an almost-forgotten Google Drive to a room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the [**Pellegrino Space Structures Lab**](http://www.pellegrino.caltech.edu/).

Our original plan was to submit a proposal for [**NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative**](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative), but it was quickly realized that we lacked the knowledge and experience (and staffing) to design an entire spacecraft mission in time for the November deadline.

But that wasn't going to stop us! We were going to build a CubeSat, darn it. And if NASA wasn't going to take us to space, we were going to have to get there ourselves.

Fast forward to March. (Time is weird at Caltech.) After a few follow-up emails to the club's faculty advisor, Prof. Ehlmann (same one), we finally got card access to the room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the Pellegrino Space Structures Lab. We immediately set to work designing the science payload (essentially just a video camera, a GPS, and an ultraviolet light sensor to look for ~~upper atmospheric lightning~~ luminous plasma! Not that we were planning on launching during a thunderstorm -- it was a proof of concept thing. But I digress.)

We then moved on to the main event: getting to space. Or close enough to it, anyway. We would launch a weather balloon, we decided, which would get our payload high enough to see the blackness of space -- but not high enough to violate FAA regulations.

This idea came from a project that a couple of our team members, the Moore Lab Subbasement Dwellers, worked on earlier in the year. There's a [**fantastic blog post**](https://caltechadmissions.blog/sending-a-high-altitude-balloon-to-space/) all about that, which goes into detail about the science of high altitude balloons!

As Plato almost said, "logistics is the mother of invention." Yes, up next were the thrilling tasks of applying for club funding, ordering parts, and lining up a helium supplier (for the balloon). [**ASCIT**](https://donut.caltech.edu/) actually turned around our funding proposal very quickly, and with a generous grant, but that was where our luck ended.
