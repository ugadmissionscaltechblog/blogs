**…Or, How a Disciple of Bethany Ehlmann, a Former Desert Militiaman, Moore Lab Subbasement Dwellers, Roblox's Newest Intern, a Florida Man, and a Luminous Plasma Scientist Went to War with the Caltech Mail Center, Got Double-Crossed by AirGas Corp., Survived Three COVID Outbreaks, and Nearly Stranded Themselves in the Mojave in order to Send a Bag of Peanuts to Space (A True Story).**

_The sun is hot. The air is bone-dry. Frankly, it's amazing that we've made it this far into the middle of nowhere, and it's going to be even more amazing if we manage to make it back out._

_In hindsight, it probably shouldn't have taken a flat tire for us to realize that what Google Maps called "Transmission Line Road" was very much not a road at all. We've come so far, now only 2.5 miles from the (alleged) landing site after a wild goose chase across half of Southern California..._

Before we get to all that, I'm afraid we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Michael Gutierrez ("Guutz"), a first-year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. (It's also my first blog post -- hello!)

I had the opportunity to embark on this adventure through the Caltech [**CubeSat Club**](https://smallsats.caltech.edu/). \[\[ **cube·sat** ║ kjub sæt ║ (n.) **1.** A cheap, bread-loaf-sized satellite that you(!) can build and [**yeet into Earth orbit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQy9EwMrILI&ab_channel=Nanoracks). \]\] The way they advertise the club makes us sound like literal rocket scientists, but the missing context is that all of its pre-pandemic members had either graduated or left by the end of last year. This left five sophomores plus one "me" to scrounge together the remnants, scattered everywhere from an almost-forgotten Google Drive to a room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the [**Pellegrino Space Structures Lab**](http://www.pellegrino.caltech.edu/).

The club's original plan was to submit a proposal for [**NASA's CubeSat Launch Initiative**](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative), but it was quickly realized that we lacked the knowledge and experience (and staffing) to design a spacecraft mission in time for the November deadline.

But that wasn't going to stop us! We were going to build a CubeSat, darn it. And if NASA wasn't going to take us to space, we were going to have to get there ourselves.

Fast forward to March. (Time is weird at Caltech.) After a few follow-up emails to the club's faculty advisor, the intrepid Prof. Ehlmann (same one), we finally got card access to the room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the Pellegrino Space Structures Lab. We immediately set to work designing the science payload (essentially just a video camera, a GPS, and an ultraviolet light sensor to look for ~~upper atmospheric lightning~~ luminous plasma! Not that we were planning on launching during a thunderstorm -- it was a proof of concept thing. But I digress.)

We then moved on to the main event: getting to space. Or close enough to it, anyway. We would launch a weather balloon, we decided, which would get our payload high enough to see the blackness of space -- but not high enough to violate FAA regulations.
