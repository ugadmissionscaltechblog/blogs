**‚Ä¶Or, How a Disciple of Bethany Ehlmann, a Former Desert Militiaman, Moore Lab Subbasement Dwellers, Roblox's Newest Intern, a Florida Man, and a Luminous Plasma Scientist Went to War with the Caltech Mail Center, Got Double-Crossed by AirGas Corp., Survived Three COVID Outbreaks, and Nearly Stranded Themselves in the Mojave in order to Send a Bag of Peanuts to Space (A True Story).**

_The sun is hot. The air is bone-dry. Frankly, it's amazing that we've made it this far into the middle of nowhere, and it's going to be even more amazing if we manage to make it back out._

_In hindsight, it probably shouldn't have taken a flat tire for us to realize that what Google Maps called "Transmission Line Road" was very much not a road at all. We've come so far, now only 2.5 miles from the (alleged) landing site after a wild goose chase across half of Southern California..._

Before we get to all that, I'm afraid we haven't been properly introduced. I'm Michael Gutierrez ("Guutz"), a first-year undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering. (It's also my first blog post -- hello!)

This adventure began at the end of winter term, when I joined Caltech's [**CubeSat Club**](https://smallsats.caltech.edu/).

> **cube¬∑sat** ‚ïë kjub s√¶t ‚ïë (n.) **1.** A tiny, inexpensive satellite, about the size of a loaf of bread, that can [**hitch a ride into Earth orbit**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQy9EwMrILI&ab_channel=Nanoracks) using empty space in another rocket.

The Caltech website plays us up _a lot_, but the missing context is that all of the club's pre-pandemic members had either graduated or left by the end of last year. This left five sophomores plus one "me", led by our intrepid president Turner Bumbary (AKA the Luminous Plasma Scientist), to scavenge through the remnants scattered everywhere from an almost-forgotten Google Drive to a room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the [**Pellegrino Space Structures Lab**](http://www.pellegrino.caltech.edu/).

Our original plan was to submit a proposal for NASA's annual [**CubeSat Launch Initiative**](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/home/CubeSats_initiative) competition, but it was quickly realized that we lacked the knowledge and experience (and staffing) to design an entire spacecraft mission in time for the deadline.

But that wasn't going to stop us! If NASA wasn't going to take us to space, we were just going to have to get there ourselves.

> WE CHOOSE TO GO TO SPACE. WE CHOOSE TO BUILD A CUBESAT **BY THE END OF THIS TERM**, AND DO THE OTHER THINGS, NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE EASY, BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE HARD. BECAUSE THAT GOAL WILL SERVE TO ORGANIZE AND MEASURE THE BEST OF OUR ENERGIES AND SKILLS. BECAUSE THAT CHALLENGE IS ONE WE ARE WILLING TO ACCEPT, ONE WE ARE UNWILLING TO POSTPONE, AND ONE WHICH WE INTEND TO WIN!

Fast forward to May. (Time is weird at Caltech.) After a few follow-up emails to the club's faculty advisor, Prof. Ehlmann (same one), we finally got card access to the room-that-everyone-thought-was-just-a-closet next to the Pellegrino Space Structures Lab. We immediately set to work designing the science payload (essentially just a video camera, a GPS, and an ultraviolet light sensor to look for ~~upper atmospheric lightning~~ luminous plasma! \[Not that we were planning on launching during a thunderstorm -- it was a proof of concept thing. But I digress.\]) || ![4 students looking very proud of their tiny, messy lab! Or, as they like to call it, home <3 (is that cheesy enough?)](https://d24slhcvzhzz82.cloudfront.net/images/2022/guutz/IMG_0696%20(1).jpg "4 students looking very proud of their tiny, messy lab! Or, as they like to call it, home <3 (is that cheesy enough?)")_Besties!_

We then moved on to the main event: getting to space. Or close enough to it, anyway. We would launch a weather balloon, we decided, which would get our payload high enough to see the blackness of space -- but not high enough to violate FAA regulations.

This idea came from a project that a couple of our team members, the Moore Lab Subbasement Dwellers, worked on earlier in the year. There's a [**fantastic blog post**](https://caltechadmissions.blog/sending-a-high-altitude-balloon-to-space/) all about that, which goes into detail about the science of high altitude balloons!

Up next were the thrilling tasks of applying for club funding, ordering parts, and lining up a helium supplier for the balloon. After all, less than a month before the drop-dead launch date is as good a time as any to start! (It actually kind of was, because nothing -- literally nothing -- motivates better than a fast-approaching deadline. \[Did you know a group of Caltech students is called a _procrastination_?\])

ASCIT, the undergrad student government, actually turned around our funding proposal very quickly -- and with a generous grant. We distributed our two-day shipping orders across the internet, spanning the whole range from the hip, new Adafruit chips with built in micro-machine-learning (overkill if you ask me) all the way to the sleaziest depths of Amaz*n. To top it off, the Facilities office made it surprisingly easy to request a tank of helium from their account with AirGas Corp.

But that was where our luck ended.

About two days later, I woke up to a terrifying sight: FOUR unread emails from Alice Edel, Senior Associate at Caltech Mail Services.

![](https://d24slhcvzhzz82.cloudfront.net/images/2022/guutz/alice4.png "There are not many people that can email everyone in the student body with a single keystroke, but Alice Edel is one of them.")

Alice Edel may be the single most powerful being in the Institute. Not even the smallest envelope will make it past 1200 E. California Blvd. without her knowing about it. If she so desired, she could bring the entire campus's operations to a screeching halt with a gesture. So when she manually sends you an email with that many exclamation marks in the subject line, you book it to the Mail Center.

So I did, and Alice was only too happy to present me with an armful of packages. After ripping them all open like a kid on Christmas day, though, I noticed we were missing a mission critical element: the GPS unit. The shipping tracker said it had been delivered, yet the Mail Center disavowed any knowledge of it.

To make matters worse, later that day we got an email from AirGas Corp., saying "sowwy (‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ>‚ÅÑ ‚ñΩ ‚ÅÑ<‚ÅÑ ‚ÅÑ).. we awen't accepting new customers wight now (*^.^).., cause of the gwobal hewium shortage üò≠" (roughly transcribed). Those cOwOards. Don't they know it's our American right to dump scarce natural resources into the atmosphere?

With less than two weeks until launch day, we were running out of options. While the rest of us were beginning to regroup, the code for the payload computer was coming along nicely, courtesy of our local CompSci major (and recent hire at ROBLOX!), Shivansh. That is, until his COVID surveillance sample came back positive. And then the PCR test. Honestly, it was really lucky that no one else on the team caught it from him, since we all worked in the same enclosed space, not to mention Caltech was having its second (third?) COVID outbreak in as many months. It was still a somber moment though, because we all knew our fallen comrade would not make it out of quarantine soon enough to see the launch in person. || ![](https://d24slhcvzhzz82.cloudfront.net/images/2022/guutz/Optimized-roblox_intern.PNG)

The team!
