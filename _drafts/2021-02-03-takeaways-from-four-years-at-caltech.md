In my last blog, I briefly talked about balancing priorities while at Caltech. I think it’s especially important to establish this early on, since it’s easy to get swept up in the work culture while here. Classes are difficult, and you’ll lose sleep despite your best efforts. But while a little sleep deprivation is entirely normal and expected, consistent sleep deprivation is not. As I wrote my grad school applications, I had a lot of opportunities to think over what I have learned at Caltech (the hard way!), so here’s what I would take away from the experience:

\- As per above: **school is important but so is your health**. Don’t jeopardize that. Life’s a marathon, not a race. Burning yourself out in college will guarantee that you won’t have a good time in grad school/med school/industry/whatever other cool thing Caltech students do after graduation. 

\- **Failure is not permanent.** Failure is never the end! You can always find the next opportunity. Experiments not working? Try other conditions. Propose an entirely different project if you must. Poor grade in a class? GPA doesn’t matter! (I feel like I’m obligated to say that I’m just kidding.) Some better advice is to figure out how to improve in your next term. Go to office hours, ask your professors for feedback.

\- **You’re here to learn.** Don’t worry about appearing uneducated, because unfortunately, compared to your professors and the grad students, you probably are. But it’s their job to change that. Ask the stupid questions! Interrupt for clarifications! The fear of looking stupid in front of a professor can be paralyzing, but maybe it could also just be that the professor is so familiar with a concept that they didn’t realize they needed to explain things. Keeping this in mind made my classes and research experiences go so much smoother. 

\- In a similar vein, **don’t be afraid to ask for help.** In the academic sense, this applies to asking your friends, classmates, TAs, even the professor. If you find a class difficult, it’s not a reflection on you at all, because it probably is a difficult class. They’re meant to challenge you! And asking for help outside of academics is just as important. Having a bad day? Communicate that. At Caltech, there will always be people watching out for you. I can’t even count the number of times I’ve come back from lab or class and announced that I desperately needed ice cream or boba, and my roommates have declared on the spot that we’d go, regardless of how busy we all were.

I’m sure this isn’t the first time that anyone’s heard of this advice, and yet, it always seems to take a long time to sink in. And sometimes, I don’t even listen to my own advice. It’s hard! We spend so much time working that sometimes it’s hard to remember to slow down for the sake of mental and even physical health. But keeping these principles (which could alternatively be called the basics of self care) in mind can make the Caltech experience that much smoother. Best of luck!
