# **Transitioning to Caltech Blog**

Coming to Caltech, I was scared, nervous, and excited. Over the summer, I tried to prep myself mentally. I told myself that it was going to be harder than I could imagine. However, I was excited for the challenge and to see how much stronger I would become and how much I would change over the next four years. Everyone I had talked to prior told me that Caltech was challenging, difficult, and would involve countless sleepless nights working on problem sets.

As I was a swim recruit, I was also excited to meet my new swim family. In addition to Caltech’s incredible academics, I chose Caltech because of its tight-knit collaborative community. I couldn’t wait to join it, but I was also nervous. I’m pretty introverted and it takes me a while to make new friends or be comfortable socializing. It didn’t help that because of COVID, I spent the majority of my time on school work in my room alone or on Zoom. While the prefrosh communicated and socialized on Discord, I had an aversion to socializing on it. I prefer to talk in person even though I am shy. Thus, I was very nervous to make new friends and expected everyone to already have Discord friend groups.

The first week was a shock. The most challenging part for me was Chem 1a. My high school only allowed us to take one Science AP (excluding CS) and so I had taken AP Physics Mechanics and E&M, not AP Chem. It was surprising to hear that we were expected to catch up on AP Chemistry by the end of the week when our first Chem problem set was due. The first few nights, my new friends and I stayed up until 3 AM (though this is pretty common now) working on the Chem set. Imposter syndrome was definitely present. While I took numerous days working on the Chem set, other frosh finished it in less than two hours. Some of my current friends finished the Math set on the first day.

However, the nice thing about Freshman core is that everyone’s working on the same sets. I spent the first couple of weeks meeting and working with different groups of frosh until I found a study group. My friends and I traveled across campus randomly joining different groups of people in the SAC, Bechtel, and the Houses. Everyone I met was friendly, welcoming, and warm. Even when I met frosh for the first time, they were eager to help and work together. We stayed up late working our sets, having handstand competitions, and drinking hot chocolate. I found a new form of collaboration and problem solving that I loved.

After that, even though the work got harder, it seemed easier as I worked with my new friends. Having the support of the swim team was also helpful. Through the swim team, I had immediate upperclassmen and teammates to ask advice from. Furthermore, as time went on, I learned about the academic resources Caltech offers including Office Hours and Peer Tutors. In particular, finding a constant and reliable Office Hours helped me adjust. Though Caltech is difficult, it provides lots of resources for academic support.

Though the transition was difficult at the time, finding friends and people to work with was a lot easier than I thought it would. Though at first, the workload seemed intimidating, the strong, tight-knit, collaborative community I joined helped me transition. While I was originally scared and nervous coming to Caltech, it truly became a home away from home.
