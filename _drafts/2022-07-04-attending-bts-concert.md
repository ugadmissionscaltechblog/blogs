# Attending BTS Concert

Prior to the fall term, I had never been to a concert. So when my roommate asked me one morning if I wanted to go to a BTS concert with her, I had to. In fact, Kpop and BTS were how we decided to become roommates. It was a little tricky to attend because it was during the week before finals. However, how often was BTS going to come to LA?

We planned our outfits, took pictures, and Lyfted to SOFI stadium. Even though we got there early, it was already swarming and packed. Vendors tried to sell us BTS shirts, sweatshirts, and bags.

We wanted to get ARMY Bombs, which are concert lightsticks. However, unfortunately, we got in line for a first-level vendor booth and they ran out. As a tip to anyone who plans on going to a BTS concert, if you want to just get an ARMY Bomb (a lightstick), it’s better to get them at the second-level vendors.

After we got our swag, we moved to the stadium. I was shocked. The stadium was huge. Thousands of people already packed the stadium while BTS’ hits played in the background. All of BTS’ music videos were playing in chronological order, from "No More Dream," all the way to "Permission to Dance." We got some food, sat down, and got ready.

Throughout the concert, BTS performed their classics such as "Fire," "Spring Day," and "Fake Love," as well as newer songs like "Black Swan," "Butter," and "Permission to Dance." While "Mikrokosmos" is definitely my favorite song (sadly they didn’t perform it), the best performance was "Fake Love." Thousands of people shouted “Fake Love” in unison while shaking their Army Bombs.

The concert was one of my favorite memories from Freshman year. Both the performance and just being around Army was an amazing experience. There’s something special about thousands of fans from around the world coming together and shouting and singing about “Loving Yourself.” I look forward to attending more concerts while at Caltech.
