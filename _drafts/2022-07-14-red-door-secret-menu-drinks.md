# Red Door Secret Menu Drinks

Red Door, like any college campus cafe, has the usual assortment of drinks on their menu—hot chocolate, coffee, tea, lemonade, and smoothies. But what’s really cool about Red Door is that you can customize most of these drinks by adding one of many syrups. And that’s where the Red Door “secret menu” drinks come from. So, here is a list of some of my favorite customized drinks at Red Door. Enjoy!

**1. Hot chocolate with hazelnut or caramel syrup**

Red Door hot chocolate is pretty good on its own, but adding hazelnut or caramel gives it an extra kick of flavor. It’s a great comfort drink for a cold-ish day (because let’s face it, it never actually gets that cold in Pasadena).

**2. Green tea Arnold Palmer with rose, peach, or strawberry syrup**

For those of you who don’t know, an Arnold Palmer is a drink made by mixing iced tea and lemonade. Red Door usually makes Arnold Palmers with black tea, but you can ask them to substitute it with green tea. Then, adding one of three listed syrups makes this the perfect refreshing drink. Strawberry syrup is probably the sweetest of the three whereas peach is the fruitiest, so keep that in mind when choosing.

**3. Lavender lemonade**

This is one of the most popular drinks on campus, and rightfully so. Adding lavender syrup to lemonade is one of the best combinations, and this drink has earned its spot as a Red Door staple. Red Door also recently added peach and strawberry syrups (mentioned earlier), and these are also great to add to lemonade!

**4. Hot latte with caramel and vanilla syrup**

Red Door has many different coffee options, but this is one of my go-to choices every morning. If you prefer flavored coffee, you’ll certainly love this drink. It’s just the right amount of sweetness, flavor, and caffeine to wake you up, so you can make it to that 9am lecture.
