Studying at Caltech is a lot like crewing a spaceship. You get to work alongside some of the most talented people on Earth, you’re constantly doing science in order to survive, and the environment tends to keep you under a lot of pressure. It’s an incredible experience, and also a very challenging one, to be sure. Sometimes you’re left feeling like an impostor among your crewmates, having failed to complete every task you think is expected of you. But fear not! These feelings are not based in reality; they are merely symptoms of a benign condition known as _impostor syndrome_. Think you might be affected? This post is for you.

Stress and mental health are matters I take very seriously. I could (and probably will) write an entire blog post about it, but for today I want to explain, and hopefully help you avoid, one aspect of it that particularly affects prospective and incoming college students.

## Let's talk about college apps.

**The bad news:** If you’re considering applying or have been accepted to Caltech, you probably don’t need me to tell you that the college admissions process is _extremely_ stressful. And how could it not be? It’s only the entire rest of your life that’s contingent on this application! One wrong word in that essay, one blemish on that transcript, or one single waking hour squandered? Kiss your dreams of changing the world goodbye! You might as well skip Backupsmore University and move straight into a log cabin in Gravity Falls, Oregon.

That was a joke. (Besides, Backupsmore rocks. Stan got out of there with a PhD and a huge grant in like 3 years.) But it’s an easy thought process to get trapped in -- I’ve certainly been there. To this day, I have trouble putting down my work and relaxing in the little downtime I get. (Hence why I am writing this at 11:49PM on a Sunday night.)

In all seriousness, defining your success and self-worth by a test score, a class rank, or an admission decision is rarely conducive to good mental health. But despite that, thousands of students every year, whether under pressure from themselves, family, peers, society, etc… will push themselves far past reasonable limits trying to live up to these arbitrary, inconsistent, and sometimes completely meaningless standards. It is my strong belief that _this sacrifice is almost never worth it_.

**The good news:** it doesn’t have to be this way! Surviving and thriving at Caltech requires strong academics, yes, but equally so it requires self-motivation, passion for what you do, and the ability to fail gracefully. Read that again. That’s why the admissions team has been working hard to make our application much more [“holistic.”](https://www.admissions.caltech.edu/apply/what-we-look-for/how-we-review) In other words, focusing less on your numbers (SAT/ACT scores are no longer required through fall 2025!) and more on your character (extracurriculars, personal statements, etc.). That doesn't mean Caltech is dropping its standards -- quite the opposite in fact -- but I hope it does allow you to stress a little less about a few percentage points ;-)
