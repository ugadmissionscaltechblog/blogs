Studying at Caltech is a lot like crewing a spaceship. You get to work alongside some of the most talented people on Earth, you’re constantly doing science in order to survive, and the environment tends to keep you under a lot of pressure. It’s an incredible experience, and also a very challenging one, to be sure. Sometimes you’re left feeling like an impostor among your crewmates, having failed to complete every task you think is expected of you. But fear not! These feelings are not based in reality; they are merely symptoms of a benign condition known as _impostor syndrome_. Think you might be affected? This post is for you.

Stress and mental health are matters I take very seriously. I could (and probably will) write an entire blog post about it, but for today I want to explain, and hopefully help you avoid, one aspect of it that particularly affects prospective and incoming college students.

## Let's talk about college apps.

**The bad news:** If you’re considering applying or have been accepted to Caltech, you probably don’t need me to tell you that the college admissions process is _extremely_ stressful. And how could it not be? It’s only the entire rest of your life that’s contingent on this application! One wrong word in that essay, one blemish on that transcript, or one single waking hour squandered? Kiss your dreams of changing the world goodbye! You might as well skip Backupsmore University and move straight into a log cabin in Gravity Falls, Oregon.
