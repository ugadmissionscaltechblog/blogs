This past term, I took [EE154a: Practical Electronics for Space Applications](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/courses/department/EE), which was one of my favorite classes Iâ€™ve taken at Caltech so far! In the class, we learned about electronics and systems in the space environment through hands-on labs, and then we used that knowledge to create payloads for a high altitude balloon (HAB) launch into space! To start off the class, in the lab, we characterized various systems like an RC (resistor-capacitor) filter, an Arduino oscillator, different sensors, etc. at various temperatures and pressures in a thermal vacuum chamber, shown here:
