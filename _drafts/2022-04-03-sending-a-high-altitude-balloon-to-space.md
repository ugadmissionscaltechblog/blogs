This past term, I took [EE154a: Practical Electronics for Space Applications](https://catalog.caltech.edu/current/courses/department/EE), which was one of my favorite classes Iâ€™ve taken at Caltech so far! In the class, we learned about electronics and systems in the space environment through hands-on labs, and then we used that knowledge to create payloads for a high altitude balloon (HAB) launch into space! To start off the class, in the lab, we characterized various systems like an RC (resistor-capacitor) filter, an Arduino oscillator, different sensors, etc. at various temperatures and pressures in a thermal vacuum chamber, shown here:

After learning how different components worked and how we could test them in a thermal vacuum chamber, we were tasked with building payloads to send into space and figuring out how to send them into space using a balloon. Essentially, we took a big balloon, filled it with helium, and then attached a string of small boxes (our payloads) to the balloon to send the payloads into space. As the balloon rises, the gas inside expands, and at some point (around 80k feet in altitude) the balloon pops. Then, the payloads fall back to Earth with a parachute and we go recover our payloads out in the desert.
