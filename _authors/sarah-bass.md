Hi, I'm a sophomore from Livermore, California (a city that claims to be part of the "bay area," though there seems to be much discourse regarding that statement). At Caltech I'm a member of PARSEC (the rocketry club), one of the Blacker house historians, and a Mechanical Engineering major. In my free time, I like to read, crochet, watch anime, and sometimes go hiking.
