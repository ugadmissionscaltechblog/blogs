Hi! I’m Rashi, a California girl who grew up in Pasadena, practically next door to campus. I’m a junior majoring in Bioengineering and would typically be spending my days at Caltech messing with the genome of E. coli in lab. On campus, I do synthetic bio research, have dabbled in a bit of electrical engineering with the Racing team, am part of the Bollywood dance team Caltech Dhamaka, and like to spend time exploring the area with friends.
