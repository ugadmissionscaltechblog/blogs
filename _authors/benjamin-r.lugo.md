I'm a sophomore in Blacker House originally from the Rio Grande Valley in South Texas (almost Mexico, but not quite). I'm the Jam Room manager for the undergraduate residences at Caltech, a member of the Radio club, bassist and rhythm guitarist for the band Aether, Caltech Admissions ambassador, PARSEC member, Surf and Windsurf club member, and FSRI alum. I'm a big nerd when it come to aerospace (especially fighter jets), and an avid guitar player whenever I can get the chance, and always down to play basketball. I like to think of myself as a simple guy who's main motivation is to have fun, continue getting better, and help others when I can.
