Hey, y’all! I’m Leah Griffith, a junior from Austin, Texas studying Computer Science and Business, Economics, & Management (BEM). As an active member of Fleming House, a Peer Advocate, an Admissions Ambassador, and a Rise Tutor, I’m pretty busy during the year! Over the summers, I’ve built a machine learning algorithm to classify supernovae with two Caltech professors and explored industry in the Bay Area working for the cybersecurity company Rapid7. On campus, you can find me in study groups or Red Door Cafe nerding out with my friends about computer science or Star Wars. Off campus, I’ll be at the beach or finding good eats in Pasadena.
