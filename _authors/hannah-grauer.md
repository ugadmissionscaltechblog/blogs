Hello! I’m Hannah, a Junior studying Electrical Engineering from the Chicagoland area. I am a member of Page House, where I serve as the Vice President. I am a tutor for the Caltech Y Rise Program and serve as a peer advocate and a title IX advocate. Beyond STEM, I enjoy playing tennis and any water related sport such as windsurfing and kayaking.
