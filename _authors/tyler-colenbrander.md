Hi! I’m Tyler and I’m a junior in Ruddock House studying Electrical Engineering, originally from Novato, CA. I’m on the Caltech Ultimate Frisbee Team, I am a Peer Advocate (PA) for my house, and I am a Teaching Assistant (TA). I am really interested in solar energy research, and I currently work part-time at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) researching solar cells for deep space missions. In my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, playing Pokemon Go, Star Wars, Rubik’s cubes, Hamilton, Lego, and airplanes!
