Hi! My name is Bea, and I am a rising junior from Houston, Tx majoring in CS with an IDS minor. I am Questbridge Scholar and President of the Questbridge Club on campus! I am also part of the Women's Tennis Team, a PA (peer advocate) and a member of Lloyd house! In my free time I love to hang out with my friends, explore LA, and learn new things.
