Hi there! My name is Shri Deshmukh and I am a senior at Caltech studying Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Environmental Science and Engineering. On campus I run Track & Field and am the leader of Caltech Dance Team as well as Caltech TBP. Off campus, I have interned at Princeton University and JPL (NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) where I've pursued my passion in robotics. In my free time I enjoy hiking/biking in nature, listening to music, and overall just having a good time with friends and family.
