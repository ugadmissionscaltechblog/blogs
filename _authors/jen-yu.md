Hi, I’m Jen! I am a native of New York City and currently a senior at Caltech majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Biology. I’m a co-captain of Caltech’s tennis team and a member of Fleming House. On campus, I’m involved with the Caltech Y, the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee and Chemistry Club. I love exploring both the urban and natural parts of Los Angeles by going out to restaurants or hiking on weekends.
