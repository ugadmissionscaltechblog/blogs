Hello world! I'm Brian, and I'm the blog's lead architect. I work closely with Tessa, our assistant director of admissions, to deliver great stories to you.

I'm obssessed with making the reader's experience more enjoyable, so please let me know how we can do better. In the Disqus box below, feel free to tell me what kinds of things you want to see and what your general experience has been when using the site. I value all feedback, positive and negative.

Outside of admissions, I love learning about physics, reading fiction, and spending time with family & friends.
