Hello! I'm Brian. I work closely with admissions, our blog lead, and the bloggers to deliver great stories to you. 

I'm obsessed with making the reader experience more enjoyable, so please let me know how we can do better in the Disqus box below. Tell me what kinds of things you want to see and what your general experience has been when using the site. I value all feedback, positive and negative.

Outside of admissions, I love learning about physics, reading fiction, and spending time with family & friends.
