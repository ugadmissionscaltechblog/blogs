Hi, I’m Emily Du (they/them)! I’m a senior from sunny San Diego and I’m a double major Chemistry + History, with a minor in Biology. On campus, I’m a member of Lloyd House, the president of Chemistry Club, treasurer for APIDA+, and involved with the Title IX Office and Board of Control. In my free time, I love playing board games with friends, exploring the Pasadena and LA food scene, going hiking or climbing, and volunteering with local organizations.
