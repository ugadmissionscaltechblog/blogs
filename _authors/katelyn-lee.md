Hi, my name is Katelyn, and I'm a junior from New York City majoring in Bioengineering! As a member of Lloyd house, I serve as the SocD (Social Director) and head LASR (Lloyd Alley Social Rep). When I'm not planning events for Lloyd, you can find me singing with the acapella group, Fluid Dynamics, tutoring in the Caltech Y RISE program, or researching paper-based diagnostic tests with the Pierce lab. I am an avid runner and museum-goer, and I love to read, tinker, and do crosswords.
