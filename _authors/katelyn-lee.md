Hi, my name is Katelyn, and I'm a senior from New York City majoring in Bioengineering! As a member of Lloyd house, I served as President and Social Director. You can also find me singing with the acapella group, Fluid Dynamics, tutoring in the Caltech Y RISE program, or developing open-source bioinstruments with the Pachter lab. I am an avid runner and museum-goer, and I love to read, tinker, and do crosswords.
