Hi! I am Vanessa, a Junior Chem major and pre-med student. I am originally from Shanghai, China but I've been living in sunny Southern California for the past 7 years. I am the Vice President of Page House, a Health Advocate, and a member of the Clemons lab. I love dancing, singing (poorly), goofing off with my friends, playing poker, and watching the same shows on Netflix for the 15th time.
