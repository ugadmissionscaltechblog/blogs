Hi! I’m Arielle, a Junior in Page house from Bethesda, Maryland. I’m majoring in Computation and Neural Systems (CNS), and I’m also pre-MD/PhD (fingers crossed). Outside of classes, you can find me organizing for environmental justice in the L.A. area, serving as the Treasurer for Caltech’s theater club (TACIT), and helping address diversity, equity, and inclusion issues on campus. I love weightlifting, dogs, and watching baseball (Go Nats!) and hockey (Go Caps!).
