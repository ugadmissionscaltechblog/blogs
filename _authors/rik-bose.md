I'm a junior from Bakersfield, California (southernmost point in the Central Valley about 2 hours north of Pasadena). At Caltech, I am a Peer Advocate and Title IX Advocate for Page House, a member of the electrical team at Caltech FSAE, research at Netlab under Dr. Steven Low, and a member of Page House's grill team. In my spare time, I enjoy both playing and watching sports (especially basketball, and F1 in Page Lounge!) and just generally vibing and having a good time with my housemates.
