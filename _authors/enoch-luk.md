Hi! I'm a sophomore from San Jose, CA (bae area) in Lloyd House. I major in CS and have research interests in computational sustainability, from computer vision for wildlife conservation to power grid optimization. I am also part of the ultimate frisbee team, student investment fund, and debate society. In my free time I like to lift, eat, and explore the LA area.
