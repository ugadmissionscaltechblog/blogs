Hello! I’m Sydney, a Junior from the Sacramento area studying Mechanical Engineering. I play on Caltech’s volleyball team and I‘m a member of Fleming house. I participate in clubs such as the Caltech Latino Association, the Society of Women Engineers, and FSAE (we build a racecar)! Alongside meeting and talking to new people, I love art, the ocean, pupusas (the national dish of El Salvador), and of course STEM!
