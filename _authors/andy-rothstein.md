Life of a Lloydie - Andy. Hello! I'm a senior physics major with a minor in aerospace engineering from from Bethesda, Maryland. I'm a member of Lloyd House (and was the president last year), help out as a dean's tutor, wait house dinners, and swim. Outside of the more structured activities, I'm always on the hunt for the best KBBQ restaurant or really any ayce place.
