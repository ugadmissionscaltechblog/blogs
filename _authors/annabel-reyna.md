Hello, my name is Annabel Reyna Gomez! I am a junior from the San Francisco Bay Area (home of the Silicon Valley) pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. On campus, I am a member of Venerable House, Club Latino, Women Mentoring Women, a Caltech Y Rise Tutor, the Mechanical Lead of the AIAA LIGO Innovation Team, and an Admissions Ambassador. Off campus, I intern at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) and work on force estimations of the InSight Mars Lander robotic arm. During my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, watching movies with my friends, painting, and silk screening.
