Hello, my name is Annabel Reyna Gomez! I am a sophomore from the San Francisco Bay Area (home of the Silicon Valley) pursuing a major in Mechanical Engineering. On campus, I am a member of Ruddock House, Club Latino, Women Mentoring Women, a Caltech Y Rise Tutor, and an Admissions Ambassador. Off campus, I intern at NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) using machine-learning to research and predic ionospheric irregularities. During my free time, I enjoy 3D printing, watching movies wit my friends, and reading personal-development.
