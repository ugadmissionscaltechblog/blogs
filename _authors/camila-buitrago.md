My name is Camila, I’m a senior from Atlanta studying Engineering and Applied Sciences with a minor in Environmental Science. I’m a part of Page house, clubs like Engineers without Borders and club Latino, and external activism groups like Extinction Rebellion. I’m passionate about climate justice, exploring the outdoors through hiking, and hugging as many trees as possible!
