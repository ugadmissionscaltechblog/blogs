Hi, I'm a sophomore from Kailua, Hawai'i. I'm majoring in Mechanical Engineering with hopes of being an aerospace engineer at NASA/JPL. I'm a member of both Lloyd House and Blacker House. I am part of Caltech's PARSEC Rocketry Club and a former member of the Cross Country and Track teams. When I'm not doing schoolwork, I like to hang out with friends, run, play the ukulele/violin, read, and play League of Legends and Valorant.
