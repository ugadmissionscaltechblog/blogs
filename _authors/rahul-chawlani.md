Hi! My name is Rahul Chawlani and I am a Junior studying Electrical Engineering from the Houston area. I am a member of Page, where I am the Social Director, and I'm also on the Caltech swim team! I do research in the Marandi Lab and outside of STEM I love the write, play the piano, and watch football and basketball in the Page Lounge.
