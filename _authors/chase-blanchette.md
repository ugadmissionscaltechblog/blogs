Hi, my name is Chase Blanchette, and I'm a junior from Ellicott City, MD studying electrical engineering. I'm the vice president of Venerable House, member of the EE subteam of Caltech Robotics Team (which builds a submersible robot), and I play Quizbowl and ultimate frisbee as well. In my spare time, you can catch me biking, hiking (I love the mountains!), reading, solving crossword puzzles, and building Rube Goldberg machines (complicated chain reactions made of everyday objects that accomplish a simple task) for my YouTube channel. Above all, I love meeting people and making puns!
